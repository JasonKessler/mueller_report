INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I 

This report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R.  § 600.8(c), which 
states that, "[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel' s work, he ... shall  provide the Attorney 
General  a  confidential  report explaining  the  prosecution  or  declination  decisions  [the  Special 
Counsel] reached." 

The  Russian  government  interfered  in  the  2016  presidential  election  in  sweeping  and 
systematic fashion.  Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016.  In 
June, the Democratic National Committee and its  cyber response team publicly announced that 
Russian hackers had compromised its  computer network.  Releases of hacked materials-hacks 
that  public  reporting  soon  attributed  to  the  Russian  government-began  that  same  month. 
Additional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in 
October and November. 

In  late  July  2016,  soon  after  WikiLeaks's  first  release  of stolen  documents,  a  foreign 
government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy 
advisor George Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos had suggested to a  representative  of that foreign 
government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that 
it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of  information  damaging  to 
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  That information prompted the FBI on July 
31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign 
were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. 

That fall,  two federal  agencies jointly announced that the Russian government "directed 
recent  compromises  of  e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions,  including  US  political 
organizations," and, " [t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election 
process."  After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia 
for  having  interfered  in  the  election.  By  early  2017,  several  congressional  committees  were 
examining Russia's interference in the election. 

Within the Executive Branch, these  investigatory efforts ultimately led  to the May 2017 
appointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III.  The order appointing the Special Counsel 
authorized  him  to  investigate  "the  Russian  government's  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 
presidential election,"  including any  links  or coordination between the Russian government and 
individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. 

As set forth  in detail  in this report,  the Special  Counsel's  investigation  established that 
Russia  interfere~ in the  2016 presidential  election principally through two  operations.  First,  a 
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. 
Trump  and  disparaged  presidential  candidate  Hillary  Clinton.  Second,  a  Russian  intelligence 
service  conducted  computer-intrusion  operations  against  entities,  employees,  and  volunteers 
working on the Clinton  Campaign and then released  stolen  documents.  The investigation also 
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.  Although 
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump 
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected  it would benefit 

Atterttey Werk Predttet // Ma~·  Cetttaitt Material Prnteeted Uttder Fed. R.  Criffl. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not 
establish  that  members  of the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  or  coordinated  with  the  Russian 
government in  its election interference activities. 

*  *  * 

Below  we  describe  the  evidentiary  considerations  underpinning  statements  about  the 
results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging decisions, and we then provide an 
overview of the two volumes of our report. 

The  report describes  actions  and  events  that  the  Special  Counsel's  Office  found  to  be 
supp01ted by the evidence collected in our investigation.  In some instances, the report points out 
the  absence of evidence or conflicts  in the  evidence  about a  particular  fact  or  event.  In  other 
instances,  when  substantial,  credible  evidence  enabled  the  Office  to  reach  a  conclusion  with 
confidence,  the  report  states  that  the  investigation  established  that  certain  actions  or  events 
occurred.  A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there 
was no evidence of those facts. 

In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted 
a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of "collusion."  In so doing, 
the  Office recognized  that the  word  "collud[ e ]"  was  used  in  communications  with the  Acting 
Attorney General  confirming  certain  aspects  of the  investigation's  scope and that the term  has 
frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation.  But collusion is not a specific 
offense or theory of liability found  in the United  States  Code, nor is  it a  term of art in federal 
criminal law.  For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability 
was on conspiracy as defined  in federal  law.  In  connection with that analysis, we addressed the 
factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign "coordinat[ ed]"-a term that appears 
in  the  appointment  order-with  Russian  election  interference  activities.  Like  collusion, 
"coordination"  does  not  have  a  settled  definition  in  federal  criminal  law.  We  understood 
coordination to  require  an agreement-tacit or express- between the  Trump Campaign and the 
Russian  government  on election  interference.  That  requires  more  than  the  two parties  taking 
actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests.  We applied the term 
coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the 
Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. 

The report on our investigation consists of two volumes:

Counsel's charging decisions. 

Volume  II addresses the President' s actions towards the FBI's investigation into Russia' s

Special Counsel' s investigation.  Volume II separately states its framework and the considerations 
that guided that investigation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I 

RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN 

The  Internet  Research  Agency  (IRA)  carried  out  the  earliest  Russian  interference 
operations  identified  by  the  investigation- a  social  media  campaign  designed  to  provoke  and 
amplify political and social discord  in the United States.  The  IRA was based in St.  Petersburg, 
Russia,  and  received  funding  from  Russian  oligarch  Y evgeniy  Prigozhin  and  companies  he 
controlled.  Pri  ozhin is widel  re  orted to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin 

In mid-2014,  the IRA sent em  lo 

mission with instructions 

The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to  sow discord in the U.S. 
political  system through  what it termed "information warfare."  The campaign  evolved from a 
generalized program  designed  in  2014  and  2015  to  undermine  the  U.S.  electoral  system,  to  a 
targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. 
The IRA' s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the 
names of U.S.  persons and  entities, as well  as  the  staging  of political rallies  inside the  United 
States.  To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and 
made  contact with Trump  supporters and  Trump Campaign officials in the United  States.  The 
investigation did  not  identify evidence that any U.S.  persons conspired or coordinated with the 
IRA.  Section  II  of this  report  details  the  Office's  investigation  of the  Russian  social  media 
campaign. 

RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS 

At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus ·on supporting candidate Trump in 
early 2016, the  Russian  government employed a  second form  of interference:  cyber intrusions 
(hacking)  and  releases  of hacked  materials  damaging  to  the  Clinton  Campaign.  The  Russian 
intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian 
Army (GRU) carried out these operations. 

In  March  2016,  the  GRU  began  hacking  the  email  accounts  of  Clinton  Campaign 
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta.  In April 2016, the GRU 
hacked  into  the  computer  networks  of the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee 
(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The GRU stole hundreds of thousands 
of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks.  Around the time that the DNC 
announced  in  mid-June  2016  the  Russian  government's  role  in  hacking  its  network,  the  GRU 
began  disseminating  stolen  materials  through  the  fictitious  online  personas  "DCLeaks"  and 
"Guccifer 2.0."  The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.

U.S. Department of Justice 

The  presidential  campaign  of Donald  J.  Trump  ("Trump  Campaign"  or  "Campaign") 
showed  interest in WikiLeaks' s releases  of documents  and welcomed their  otential to damage 
candidate Clinton.  Beginning in June 2016, llfilllillliliilfll~llliillllllilllilli 
forecast to 
senior  Campaign  officials  that  WikiLeaks  would  release  information  damaging  to  candidate 
Clinton.  WikiLeaks' s first release came in July 2016.  Around the same time, candidate Trump 
announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server 
used b  Clinton when she was Secreta  of State  he later said that he was s · eakin  sarcasticall 
. 

WikiLeaks  began  releasing 
Podesta' s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released 
video considered damaging to candidate Trump.  Section  lII  of this  Report  details  the  Office's 
investigation  into the Russian  hacking operations,  as  well as  other  efforts  by Trump Campaign 
supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails. 

RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN 

The social media campaign and the GRU  hacking operations coincided with a  series of 
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. 
The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted  in the Campaign conspiring 
or  coordinating  with  Russia  in  its  election-interference  activities.  Although  the  investigation 
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and 
worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from 
information stolen and released through Russian efforts,  the  investigation  did  not establish that 
members  of the  Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with  the Russian  government in its 
election interference activities. 

The  Russian  contacts  consisted  of  business  connections,  offers  of  assistance  to  the 
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in  person, invitations for Campaign 
officials  and  representatives  of the  Russian government to  meet,  and  policy  positions  seeking 
improved U.S.-Russian relations.  Section IV of this  Report details the contacts  between Russia 
and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which 
are summarized below in chronological order. 

2015.  Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization 
real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.  Candidate Trump signed a Letter 
oflntent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization 
executive  Michael  Cohen  emailed  and  spoke  about  the  project  with  the  office  of Russian 
government press secretary Dmitry Peskov.  The Trump Organization pursued the project through 
at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump. 

Spring 2016.  Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact 
with  Joseph  Mifsud,  a London-based professor who  had  connections to  Russia  and  traveled  to 
Moscow  in  April  2016. 
Immediately  upon  his  return  to  London  from  that trip,  Mifsud  told 
Papadopoulos that the Russian government had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands

l\.ttortte~· Work Pt'od1:1et // Mtty Cotttttitt Mttterittl Proteeted Uttder Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 

U.S.  Department of Justice 

of emails.  One  week  later,  in  the  first  week  of May  2016,  Papadopoulos  suggested  to  a 
representative of a foreign  government that the Trump Campaign had received  indications from 
the  Russian  government  that  it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of 
information damaging to candidate Clinton.  Throughout that period of time and for several months 
thereafter,  Papadopoulos worked  with  Mifsud  and  two  Russian  nationals  to  arrange  a  meeting 
between the Campaign and the Russian government.  No meeting took place. 

Summer 2016.  Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the  summer of 
2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President.  On 
June 9,  2016, for example, a  Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald 
Trump  Jr.,  Jared  Kushner,  and  campaign  chairman  Paul  Manafort  to  deliver  what  the  email 
proposing  the  meeting  had  described  as  "official  documents  and  information  that  would 
incriminate  Hillary."  The  materials  were  offered  to  Trump  Jr.  as  "part  of Russia  and  its 
government's  support  for  Mr.  Trump."  The  written  communications  setting  up  the  meeting 
showed  that  the  Campaign  anticipated  receiving  information  from  Russia  that  could  assist 
candidate Trump's electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer' s presentation did not provide such 
information. 

Days  after  the  June  9  meeting,  on  June  14,  2016,  a  cybersecurity  firm  and  the  DNC 
announced  that  Russian  government  hackers  had  infiltrated  the  DNC  and  obtained  access  to 
opposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents. 

In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity 
to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School.  Page had lived and worked 
in Russia between 2003  and 2007.  After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted 
with  at  least two  Russian  intelligence  officers,  one  of whom was  later  charged  in  2015  with 
conspiracy to  act as  an unregistered agent of Russia.  Page' s July 2016 trip to  Moscow and his 
advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself 
from Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign. 

July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the 
DNC.  On July  22,  2016,  WikiLeaks  posted  thousands  of internal  DNC  documents  revealing 
information  about  the  Clinton  Campaign.  Within  days,  there  was  public  reporting  that  U.S. 
intelligence agencies had "high confidence" that the Russian government was.behind the theft of 
emails and documents from the DNC.  And within a week of the release,  a  foreign government 
informed the FBI about  its  May 2016  interaction with Papadopoulos  and his statement that the 
Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign.  On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign 
government rep01ting, the  FBI  opened an  investigation  into  potential coordination between the 
Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. 

Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York 
City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties 
to  Russian  intelligence.  Kilimnik  requested  the meeting to  deliver  in person  a  peace plan for 
Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a "backdoor" way for 
Russia to control  part of eastern  Ukraine;  both  men  believed the  plan would  require  candidate 
Trump's assent to succeed (were he to be elected President).  They also discussed the status of the

U.S. Department of Justice 

Trump  Campaign and Manafort's strategy for  winning  Democratic votes  in Midwestern states. 
Months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, 
and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting. 

Fall 2016.  On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in 
graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy.  Less 
than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release:  thousands  of John Podesta' s emails that 
had been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016.  The FBI and other U.S. government institutions 
were at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere 
in the presidential election.  That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and 
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement "that the Russian 
Government  directed  the  recent  compromises  of e-mails  from  US  persons  and  institutions, 
including from  US  political organizations."  Those "thefts" and the "disclosures"  of the hacked 
materials through online platforms such as  WikiLeaks, the statement continued, "are intended to 
interfere with the US election process." 

Post-2016 Election.  Immediately  after  the  November  8  election,  Russian  government 
officials  and  prominent  Russian  businessmen  began  trying  to  make  inroads  into  the  new 
administration.  The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts.  The 
Russian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to 
arrange a call with President Putin.  Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there. 

Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was among 
the Russians who tried to  make contact with the  incoming administration.  In early December, a 
business  associate steered  Dmitriev to  Erik Prince,  a  supporter of the Trump Campaign and an 
associate  of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon.  Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face  in 
January  2017  in  the  Seychelles  and  discussed  U.S.-Russia  relations.  During the  same period, 
another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served 
on the Campaign or the Transition Team.  Dmitriev and Kushner's friend collaborated on a short 
written  reconciliation  plan for  the  United States  and  Russia, which Dmitriev  implied  had  been 
cleared through  Putin.  The friend  gave that  proposal  to Kushner  before the inauguration,  and 
Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. 

On December 29,  2016, then-President Obama imposed  sanctions  on  Russia for having 
interfered  in the  election.  Incoming National  Security Advisor Michael  Flynn  called  Russian 
Ambassador  Sergey  Kislyak and  asked  Russia  not  to  escalate  the  situation  in  response  to the 
sanctions.  The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in 
response to the sanctions at that time.  Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, "Great move 
on delay (by V. Putin)."  The next day, on December 31 , 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him 
the request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result 
of Flynn's request. 

On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump 
on a joint assessment-drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and 

* * *

Atterttey 'Nerk Prndttet // Mtty Cetttttitt Moterisl Preteeted Uttder Fed. R.  Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

National Security Agency-that concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the 
election  through  a  variety  of means  to  assist  Trump's  candidacy  and  harm  Clinton' s.  A 
declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day. 

Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees-the 
House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence  (HPSCI), the  Senate  Select Committee on 
Intelligence  (SSCI),  and  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  (SJC)-announced  that  they  would 
conduct  inquiries,  or  had  already  been  conducting  inquiries,  into  Russian  interference  in  the 
election.  Then-FBI Director James Corney later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's 
investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election.  On March 20, 2017, in 
open-session testimony before HPSCI, Corney stated: 

I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part 
of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts 
to  interfere  in  the  2016  presidential  election,  and  that  includes  investigating  the 
nature of any links  between individuals  associated with the Trump campaign and 
the  Russian  government  and  whether  there  was  any  coordination  between  the 
campaign and Russia' s efforts ....  As with any counterintelligence investigation, 
this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. 

The  investigation continued  under then-Director Corney for  the  next seven weeks  until  May  9, 
2017,  when  President  Trump  fired  Corney  as  FBI  Director-an  action  which  is  analyzed  in 
Volume II of the rep01t. 

On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel 
and authorized him to conduct the investigation that Corney had confirmed in his congressional 
testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within 
the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the 
investigation. 

President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel's appointment.  He told advisors 
that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions 
unrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in 
efforts to curtail the  Special Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to  it, 
including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses.  Those and related actions 
are described and analyzed in Volume II of the report. 

THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CHARGING DECISIONS 

* * * 

In  reaching  the  charging  decisions  described  in  Volume  1  of the  report,  the  Office 
determined  whether  the  conduct  it  found  amounted  to  a  violation  of federal  criminal  law 
chargeable under the Principles of Federal  Prosecution.  See  Justice  Manual  § 9-27.000  et seq. 
(2018).  The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if 
so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction;

A1:1:erHey \¥erk Predt1et // Mey CeHtttiH Matel'ial Pl'eteeted UHder Fed. R. Criffl. P.  6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

and  whether prosecution would  serve a  substantial federal  interest that could  not be adequately 
served  by  prosecution elsewhere or through  non-criminal  alternatives.  See Justice Manual  § 9-
27 .220. 

Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office's charging decisions, 

which contain three main components. 

First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference operations in the 2016 

U.S. presidential election-the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations(cid:173)
violated  U.S.  criminal  law.  Many of the  individuals  and  entities  involved  in  the  social media 
campaign  have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to  defraud the  United States by 
undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign 
influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft.  See United States v.  Internet 
Research Agency,  et al.,  No.  18-cr-32  (D.D.C.).  Separately,  Russian  intelligence  officers  who 
carried  out the  hacking  into  Democratic  Party  computers  and  the  personal  email  accounts  of 
individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal  laws, 
the  federal  computer-intrusion  statute,  and  the  have  been  so  char  ed.  See  United  States  v. 
Ne  ksho,  et al., No.  18-cr-215  D.D.C .. 

Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to 
the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was 
not sufficient to support criminal charges.  Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to 
charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian 
principal.  And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks' s releases of hacked 
materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation.  Further, the evidence 
was  not  sufficient  to  charge  that  any  member  of  the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  with 
representatives of the Russian government to interfere in  the 2016 election. 

Third,  the  investigation  established  that  several  individuals  affiliated  with  the  Trump 
Campaign  lied  to  the  Office,  and  to  Congress,  about their  interactions  with  Russian-affiliated 
individuals  and  related  matters.  Those  lies  materially  impaired  the  investigation  of Russian 
election  interference.  The Office charged  some of those  lies  as  violations of the federal  false(cid:173)
statements statute.  Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about 
his  interactions  with  Russian  Ambassador  Kislyak  during  the  transition  period.  George 
Papadopoulos,  a  foreign  policy  advisor during the campaign period,  pleaded  guilty to  lying to 
investigators about,  inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the 
professor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of 
thousands  of emails.  Former  Trump  Organization  attorney  Michael  Cohen

U.S. Department of Justice 

Manafort  lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and  communications 
with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine. 

* * * 

The Office  investigated  several other events that have been publicly repot1ed to involve 
potential  Russia-related  contacts.  For  example,  the  investigation  established  that  interactions 
between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate's April 
2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National 
Convention were brief, public, and non-substantive.  And the  investigation did not establish that 
one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing 
assistance  to  Ukraine  were  undertaken  at  the  behest  of candidate  Trump  or  Russia.  The 
investigation also  did  not establish that a  meeting  between Kislyak and  Sessions  in  September 
2016  at Sessions's Senate  office  included any more  than a  passing mention of the  presidential 
campaign. 

The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete 
picture of the activities  undertaken by subjects of the  investigation.  Some individuals  invoked 
their Fifth  Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and  were not,  in the Office' s 
judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity.  The Office limited its pursuit of other 
witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be 
members  of the  media-in light  of internal  Depa11ment  of Justice  policies.  See,  e.g. ,  Justice 
Manual§§ 9-13.400, 13.410.  Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was 
presumptively  covered  by  legal  privilege  and  was  screened  from  investigators  by  a  filter  ( or 
"taint")  team.  Even  when  individuals  testified  or  agreed  to  be  interviewed,  they  sometimes 
provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges 
described above.  And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as 
well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United 
States. 

Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct 
we  investigated-including  some  associated  with  the  Trump  Campaign---deleted  relevant 
communications  or  communicated  during  the  relevant  period  using  applications  that  feature 
encryption or that do  not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records.  In 
such  cases,  the  Office  was  not  able  to  corroborate  witness  statements  through  comparison  to 
contemporaneous  communications  or fully  question  witnesses  about  statements  that  appeared 
inconsistent with other known facts. 

Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office 
believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, 
the Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional 
light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.

I.  THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION 

On May  17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod  J. Rosenstein-then serving as Acting 
Attorney General for the Russia investigation following the recusal  of former Attorney General 
Jeff  Sessions  on  March  2,  2016-appointed  the  Special  Counsel  "to  investigate  Russian 
interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters."  Office of the Deputy Att'y 
Gen., Order No. 3915-2017, Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference 
with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters, May 17, 2017) ("Appointment Order"). 
Relying on "the authority vested" in the Acting Attorney General, "including 28  U.S.C. §§  509, 
510, and  515," the  Acting Attorney General  ordered  the  appointment of a  Special  Counsel "in 
order  to  discharge  [the  Acting  Attorney  General's]  responsibility  to  provide  supervision  and 
management of the Department of Justice, and to ensure a full  and thorough investigation of the 
Russian government's efforts to  interfere  in the 2016 presidential election."  Appointment Order 
(introduction). "The Special Counsel," the Order stated, "is authorized to conduct the investigation 
confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Corney in testimony before the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017," including: 

' 

(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals 

associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and 

(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and 

(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). 

Appointment Order ,r (b).  Section 600.4 affords the Special Counsel "the authority to investigate 
and  prosecute federal  crimes  committed in the  course of,  and with  intent to  interfere  with, the 
Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, 
and intimidation of witnesses."  28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).  The authority to investigate "any matters 
that arose . .. directly from the investigation," Appointment Order ,r (b)(ii), covers similar crimes 
that may have occurred during the course of the FBI's confirmed investigation before the Special 
Counsel's  appointment.  "If the  Special  Counsel  believes  it  is  necessary  and  appropriate,"  the 
Order further provided, "the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from 
the investigation of these matters."  Id. ,r ( c ).  Finally, the Acting Attorney General made applicable 
"Sections 600.4 through 600.10 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations."  Id. ,r (d). 

The  Acting  Attorney  General  further  clarified  the  scope  of the  Special  Counsel's 
investigatory authority  in two  subsequent memoranda.  A  memorandum dated  August 2, 2017, 
explained that the Appointment Order had been "worded categorically in order to permit its public 
It  then 
release  without  confirming  specific  investigations  involving  specific  individuals." 
confirmed  that  the  Special  Counsel  had  been  authorized  since  his  appointment to  investigate 
allegations  that  three  Trump  campaign  officials-Carter  Page,  Paul  Manafort,  and  George 
Papadopoulos- "committed a  crime or crimes  by colluding with  Russian  government officials 
with respect to the Russian government's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election." 
The  memorandum  also  confirmed  the  Special  Counsel's  authority  to  investigate  certain  other 
matters,  including  two  additional  sets  of allegations  involving  Manafort  (crimes  arising  from 
payments he received from the Ukrainian government and crimes arising from his receipt of loans 

11 

Att:ert1ey Werk Predttet: // Ma~· Cet'tl:aiA Material Pret:eet:ed Ut1der Fed. R. Criffl.  P.  6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

from  a bank whose CEO was then seeking a position in the Trump Administration); allegations 
that Papadopoulos committed a crime or crimes by  acting as an unregistered agent of the Israeli 
government;  and four sets of allegations involving Michael Flynn, the former National Security 
Advisor to President Trump. 

On  October  20,  2017,  the  Acting  Attorney  General  confirmed  in  a  memorandum  the 
Special Counsel's investigative authority as to several individuals and entities.  First, "as part of a 
full  and  thorough  investigation  of the  Russian  government's  efforts  to  interfere  in  the  2016 
presidential election," the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate "the pertinent activities 
of Michael Cohen, Richard Gates, 

I"  "Confirmation  of the  authorization  to  investigate  such  individuals,"  the  memorandum 

, Roger Stone, and 

stressed, "does not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a determination that any of them has 
committed a  crime."  Second, with respect to Michael Cohen, the memorandum recognized the 
Special  Counsel' s authority  to  investigate " leads  relate[d]  to  Cohen' s establishment and use of 
Essential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from Russian-backed entities."  Third, the 
memorandum memorialized the Special Counsel's authority to investigate individuals and entities 
who  were  possibly  engaged  in  "jointly  undertaken  activity"  with  existing  subjects  of the 
investigation, including Paul Manafort.  Finally, the memorandum described an FBI investigation 
opened before the  Special  Counsel's  appointment into "allegations that [then-Attorney  General 
Jeff Sessions]  made false  statements to the United  States  Senate[,]"  and confirmed the  Special 
Counsel's authority to investigate that matter. 

The Special  Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority  "to 
exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions  of any  United States Attorney."  28  C.F.R: 
§ 600.6.  Like  a  U.S.  Attorney's  Office,  the  Special  Counsel's  Office  considered  a  range  of 
classified and  unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office's Russia 
investigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions 
of federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution). 
There was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the  inception of 
the  investigation  in  May  2017 because the  FBI had,  by that time,  already  investigated Russian 
election interference for nearly  10 months.  The Special Counsel's Office exercised its judgment 
regarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact 
between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities. 

The Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian 
government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain proceedings associated 
with the Office's work remain ongoing.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to  other components 
of the Department of Justice and FBI.  Appendix D  lists those transfers. 

Two district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel's authority to investigate 
Russia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign.  See United 
States v.  Manafort, 312 F.  Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018);  United States v.  Manafort,  321  F. 
Supp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018).  In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office 
periodically  identified evidence of potential  criminal  activity that was  outside  the  scope  of the 
Special Counsel's authority established by the Acting Attorney General.  After consultation with 

12 

Att6rHey  1ilt6rk Pr6dttet // M!t)· C61\taiA Material Pr6teeted Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6Ee) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the  Office referred that evidence to  appropriate law 
enforcement authorities, principally other components of the Department of Justice and to the FBI. 
Appendix D summarizes those referrals. 

* * * 

To carry out the investigation and prosecution of the matters assigned to him, the Special 
Counsel assembled a team that at  its high point included 19 attorneys-five of whom joined the 
Office  from  private  practice  and  14  on  detail  or  assigned  from  other  Department  of Justice 
components.  These  attorneys  were  assisted  by  a  filter  team  of Department  lawyers  and  FBI 
personnel  who  screened materials obtained via court process  for  privileged  information  before 
turning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the 
Department's  Antitrust  Division;  and  an  administrative  staff of nine  responsible  for  budget, 
finance,  purchasing,  human  resources,  records,  facilities,  security,  information technology,  and 
administrative support.  The Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and 
worked  alongside  approximately  40  FBI  agents,  intelligence  analysts,  forensic  accountants,  a 
paralegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBI to assist the Special Counsel's investigation. 
Those  "assigned"  FBI  employees  remained  under FBI supervision at  all  times;  the matters  on 
which they assisted were supervised by the Special Counsel. 1 

During its investigation the Office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas under the auspices of 
a grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia; executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants; 
obtained more than 230 orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C.  § 2703(d); obtained 
almost  50  orders  authorizing  use  of pen  registers;  made  13  requests  to  foreign  governments 
pursuant  to  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  Treaties;  and  interviewed  approximately  500  witnesses, 
including almost 80 before a grand jury. 

* * * 

From  its  inception,  the  Office  recognized  that  its  investigation  could  identify  foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence  information relevant to  the FBI's broader national security 
mission.  FBI  personnel who  assisted  the  Office established procedures to  identify and convey 
such information to the FBI.  The FBI's Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly 
for  that  purpose  for  most of the  Office's  tenure.  For  more than  the  past year,  the  FBI  also 
embedded personnel at the  Office who did not work on the Special Counsel's investigation,  but 
whose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send-in writing-summaries 
of foreign  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  information  to  FBIHQ  and  FBI  Field  Offices. 
Those  communications  and  other  correspondence  between  the  Office  and  the  FBI  contain 
information derived from  the  investigation, not all  of which is  contained  in this  Volume.  This 
Volume is a summary.  It contains, in the Office's judgment, that information necessary to account 
for the Special Counsel's prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation's 
main factual results. 

1 FBI personnel assigned to the Special Counsel's Office were required to adhere to all applicable 
federal law and all Department and FBI regulations, guidelines, and policies.  An FBI attorney worked on 
FBI-related matters for the Office, such as FBI compliance with all FBI policies and procedures, including 
the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG).  That FBI attorney worked under FBI 
legal supervision, not the Special Counsel's supervision.

II.  RUSSIAN "ACTIVE MEASURES" SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN 

The first form  of Russian election influence came  principally from the Internet Research 
Agency,  LLC  (IRA),  a  Russian  organization funded  by  Yevgeniy  Viktorovich  Prigozhin  and 
companies  he  controlled,  including  Concord  Management  and  Consulting  LLC  and  Concord 
Catering (collectively "Concord").2  The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large 
U.S. audiences  with the goal of sowing discord  in  the U.S. political system.3  These  operations 
constituted "active measures" (aKTMBHbie Meporrprumu1), a term that typically refers to operations 
conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.4 

The IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014. 
Using fictitious  U.S.  personas, IRA employees operated social  media accounts and group  pages 
designed  to  attract  U.S.  audiences.  These groups  and accounts,  which addressed divisive  U.S. 
political  and social  issues, falsely  claimed to  be  controlled  by  U.S.  activists.  Over time, these 
social media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences.  IRA employees travelled to 
the  United  States  in  mid-2014  on an  intelligence-gathering  mission  to  obtain information  and 
photographs for use in their social media posts. 

IRA employees posted derogatory  information about a number of candidates in the 2016 
U.S. presidential election.  By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump 
Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton.  The IRA made various expenditures to carry 
out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. 
persons and entities.  Some IRA employees, posing as U.S.  persons and without revealing their 
Russian  association,  communicated  electronically  with  individuals  associated  with  the  Trump 
Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the 
staging  of political  rallies.5  The  investigation  did  not  identify  evidence that any  U.S.  persons 
knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation. 

By the  end of the 2016 U.S.  election, the IRA had the  ability  to  reach millions of U.S. 
persons  through  their  social  media  accounts.  Multiple  IRA-controlled  Facebook  groups  and

Instagram  accounts  had  hundreds  of thousands  of U.S.  participants. 
IRA-controlled  Twitter 
accounts separately had tens of thousands of followers,  including multiple U.S.  political figures 
who retweeted IRA-created content.  In November 2017, a Facebook representative testified that 
Facebook had  identified  470  IRA-controlled Facebook  accounts  that collectively made  80,000 
posts between January 2015 and August 2017.  Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 
126 million persons through its Face book accounts. 6  In January 2018, Twitter announced that it 
had  identified  3,814  IRA-controlled  Twitter  accounts  and  notified  approximately  1 .4  million

estimate that roughly 29 million people were served content in their News Feeds directly from the IRA's

120,000 pieces of content during that time.  Facebook did not offer an estimate of the audience reached via

2..  U.S. Operations Through IRA-Controlled Social Media Accounts 

Dozens  of IRA  employees  were  responsible  for  operating  accounts  and  personas  on 
different U.S.  social media platforms.  The IRA referred  to  employees  assigned to  operate the 
social  media  accounts  as  "specialists."42  Starting  as  early  as 2014, the  IRA' s  U.S.  operations 
included social media specialists focusing on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.43  The IRA later 
added specialists who operated on Tumblr and Instagram accounts.44 

Initially, the IRA created social media accounts that pretended to be the personal accounts 
of U.S. persons.45  By early 2015, the IRA began to  create larger  social media groups or public 
social  media  pages  that  claimed  (falsely)  to  be  affiliated  with  U.S.  political  and  grassroots 
organizations.  In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real  U.S. organizations. 
For example, one IRA-controlled Twitter account, @TEN_ GOP, purported to be connected to the 
Tennessee  Republican  Party.46  More  commonly,  the  IRA  created  accounts  in  the  names  of 
fictitious  U.S.  organizations  and  grassroots  groups  and  used  these  accounts  to  pose  as  anti(cid:173)
immigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and 
political activists.

groups (with  names  such as "Being Patriotic,"  "Stop All Immigrants," "Secured Borders," and 
"Tea Party News"), purported  Black social justice groups  ("Black Matters,"  "Blacktivist,"  and 
"Don't Shoot Us"), LGBTQ groups ("LGBT United"), and religious groups ("United Muslims of 
America"). 

Throughout 2016, IRA accounts published an increasing number of materials supporting 
the Trump Campaign and opposing the Clinton Campaign.  For example,  on May 31, 2016, the 
operational  account "Matt Skiber"  began to privately message  dozens  of pro-Trump  Facebook 
groups asking them to help plan a "pro-Trump rally near Trump Tower."55 

To  reach  larger  U.S.  audiences,  the IRA purchased  advertisements from  Facebook that 
promoted the IRA groups on the newsfeeds of U.S. audience members.  According to Facebook, 
the  IRA  purchased  over  3,500  advertisements,  and  the  expenditures  totaled  approximately 
$100,000.56 

During  the  U.S.  presidential  campaign,  many  IRA-purchased  advertisements  explicitly 
supported  or  opposed  a  presidential  candidate  or promoted  U.S.  rallies  organized  by the  IRA 
( discussed  below).  As  early  as  March  2016,  the  IRA  purchased  advertisements  that  overtly 
opposed  the  Clinton  Campaign.  For  example,  on  March  18,  2016,  the  IRA  purchased  an 
advertisement depicting candidate Clinton and  a  caption that read  in part,  " If one day God lets 
this  liar enter the  White  House  as  a  president - that day would  be  a  real  national  tragedy."57 
Similarly, on April  6,  2016,  the IRA purchased advertisements for  its  account "Black Matters" 
calling for a "flashmob" of U.S. persons to "take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or 
#nohillary2016."58 
IRA-purchased  advertisements  featuring  Clinton  were,  with  very  few 
exceptions, negative.59 

IRA-purchased  advertisements  referencing  candidate  Trump  largely  supported  his 
campaign.  The first  known  IRA advertisement explicitly endorsing the Trump  Campaign was 
purchased on April  19, 2016.  The IRA bought an advertisement for  its Instagram account "Tea 
Party News" asking U.S. persons to help them "make a patriotic team of young Trump supporters" 
by  uploading  photos  with  the  hashtag  "#KIDS4TRUMP."60 
In  subsequent  months,  the  IRA 
purchased dozens of advertisements supporting the Trump Campaign, predominantly through the 
Facebook groups "Being Patriotic," "Stop All Invaders," and "Secured Borders."

Collectively,  the IRA's social media  accounts  reached  tens  of millions  of U.S. persons. 
Individual IRA social media accounts attracted hundreds of thousands of followers.  For example, 
at  the  time  they  were  deactivated  by  Facebook  in  mid-2017,  the  IRA's  "United  Muslims  of 
America" Facebook group had over 300,000 followers, the "Don't Shoot Us" Facebook group had 
over 250,000 followers,  the "Being Patriotic" Facebook group had over 200,000 followers, and 
the "Secured Borders" Facebook group had over 130,000 followers.61  According to Facebook, in 
total the IRA-controlled accounts made over 80,000 posts before their deactivation in August 2017, 
and these posts reached at least 29 million U.S persons and "may have reached an estimated 126 
million people."62

The  IRA  operated  individualized  Twitter  accounts  similar  to  the  operation  of its  Facebook 
accounts, by continuously posting original content to the accounts while also communicating with 
U.S. Twitter users directly (through public tweeting or Twitter's private messaging). 

66 

The  IRA  used  many  of these  accounts  to  attempt  to  influence  U.S.  audiences  on  the 
election. 
Individualized  accounts  used  to  influence  the  U.S.  presidential  election  included 
@TEN_ GOP ( described above); @jenn _ abrams ( claiming to be a Virginian Trump supporter with 
70,000  followers);  @Pamela_Moore13  (claiming to  be a  Texan  Trump  supporter with 70,000 
followers);  and @America:__Ist_ (an anti-immigration persona with 24,000 followers).67  In May 
2016, the IRA created the Twitter account @march_for_trump, which  promoted IRA-organized 
rallies in support of the Trump Campaign (described below).68 

Using these accounts and others, the IRA provoked reactions from users and the media.  Multiple 
IRA-posted tweets gained popularity.70 U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled 
accounts  and attributed them to the  reactions of real  U.S. persons.71  Similarly, numerous high-

5.  U.S. Operations Involving Political Rallies 

The IRA organized and promoted political rallies inside the United States while posing as 
U.S.  grassroots  activists.  First,  the  IRA  used  one  of  its  preexisting  social  media  personas 
(Facebook groups and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event.  The 
IRA then sent a  large number of direct messages to followers of its social media account asking 
them to attend the event.  From those who responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought 
a U.S. person to serve as the event's coordinator.  In most cases, the IRA account operator would 
tell the U.S. person that they personally could not attend the event due to some preexisting conflict 
or because they were somewhere else in the United States.82  The IRA then further promoted the 
event by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to speak with the coordinator.83 
After the event, the IRA posted videos and photographs  of the event to  the IRA 's  social  media 
accounts. 84 

The Office identified dozens of U.S. rallies organized by the IRA. The earliest evidence of 
a rally was a "confederate rally" in November 2015. 85  The IRA continued to organize rallies even 
after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The attendance at rallies varied.  Some rallies appear to 
have drawn few (if any) pa1tici2ants  while others drew hundreds  The reach and success of these

From June 2016  until the end of the presidential campaign, 
almost all  of the U.S.  rallies  organized by the IRA focused  on  the 
U.S.  election, often promoting the Trump  Campaign and opposing 
the  Clinton  Campaign.  Pro-Trump  rallies  included three  in  New 
York; a series of pro-Trump rallies in Florida in August 2016; and a 
series of pro-Trump rallies  in October 2016 in Pennsylvania.  The 
Florida rallies  drew  the  attention  of the Trump  Campaign,  which 
posted  about  the  Miami  rally  on  candidate  Trump's  Facebook 
account (as discussed below).86

7.  Interactions and Contacts with the Trump Campaign 

The  investigation  identified  two  different  forms  of connections  between  the  IRA  and 
. members of the Trump Campaign.  (The investigation identified no similar connections between 
the IRA and the Clinton Campaign.)  First, on multiple occasions, members and surrogates of the 
Trump Campaign promoted-typically by linking, retweeting, or similar methods of reposting(cid:173)
pro-Trump  or anti-Clinton content published by  the  IRA  through  IRA-controlled  social  media 
accounts.  Additionally, in a few instances, IRA employees represented themselves as U.S. persons 
to  communicate  with  members  of the  Trump  Campaign  in  an  effort  to  seek  assistance  and 
coordination on IRA-organized political rallies inside the United States. 

a.  Trump Campaign Promotion of IRA Political Materials 

Among the U.S. "leaders of public  opinion" targeted by the IRA were various  members 
and surrogates of the Trump Campaign.  In total, Trump Campaign affiliates promoted dozens of 
tweets, posts, and other political content created by the IRA. 

Posts  from  the  IRA-controlled  Twitter  account  @TEN_GOP  were  cited  or  retweeted  by 
multiple  Trump  Campaign  officials  and  surrogates,  including  Donald  J.  Trump  Jr.,96  Eric

b.  Contact with  Trump Campaign Officials in  Connection to Rallies 

Starting in June 2016, the IRA contacted different U.S. persons affiliated with the Trump 
Campaign in an effort to coordinate pro-Trump IRA-organized rallies inside the United States.  In 
all cases, the IRA contacted the Campaign while claiming to be U.S. political activists working on 
behalf of a conservative grassroots organization.  The IRA's contacts included requests for signs 
and other materials to use at rallies, 107 as well as requests to promote the rallies and help coordinate 
Iogistics.108  While  certain  campaign  volunteers  agreed  to  provide  the  requested  support  (for 
example, agreeing to set aside a  number of signs),  the investigation has not identified evidence 
that any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals. 

* * * 

In sum, the investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election 
through the  "active  measures"  social  media campaign  carried  out by  the IRA,  an  organization 
funded by Prigozhin and companies that he controlled.  As explained further in Volume I, Section 
V.A, infra, the Office concluded (and a grand jury has alleged) that Prigozhin, his companies, and 
IRA employees violated U.S.  law through these operations, principally by undermining through 
deceptive  acts  the  work of federal  agencies  charged  with regulating  foreign  influence  in  U.S. 
elections.

III.  RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS 

Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation' s Main Intelligence Directorate 
of the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, e·mployees, 
and  volunteers  supporting  the  Clinton  Campaign,  including  the  email  account  of campaign 
chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the 
Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee  (DCCC)  and  the  Democratic  National 
Committee (DNC).  The  GRU targeted hundreds  of email  accounts used  by Clinton Campaign 
employees, advisors, and volunteers.  In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents 
from the  compromised email accounts  and  networks. 109  The GRU later released stolen Clinton 
Campaign and DNC documents through online personas, "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0," and later 
through the organization WikiLeaks.  The release of the  documents  was  designed  and timed to 
interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.

A.  GRU Hacking Directed at the Clinton Campaign 

1.  GRU Units Target the Clinton Campaign 

Two  military  units  of the  GRU  carried  out  the  computer  intrusions  into  the  Clinton 
Campaign, DNC, and DCCC:  Military Units 26165 and 74455. 110  Military Unit 26165 is a GRU 
cyber  unit  dedicated  to  targeting  military,  political,  governmental,  and  non-governmental 
organizations outside of Russia, including in the United States. 111  The unit was sub-divided into 
departments  with  different  specialties.  One  department,  for  example,  developed  specialized 
malicious software  "malware" , while another de  artment conducted large-scale spearphishing 
campaigns. 112  jfllllililliliilllilli

the hacking of these computers, principally with conspiring to commit computer intrusions, in violation of 
18  U.S.C.  §§ 1030 and 371.  See Volume I, Section V.B, infra;  Indictment,  United States v.  Netyksho, No.

Military Unit 74455 is a related GRU unit with multiple departments that engaged in cyber 
operations.  Unit 74455 assisted in the release of documents stolen by Unit 26165, the promotion 
of those releases, and the publication of anti-Clinton content on social media accounts operated by 
the  GRU.  Officers from Unit 74455  separately hacked computers belonging to  state boards of 
elections,  secretaries  of state, and  U.S.  companies that supplied software  and  other technology 
related to the administration of U.S. elections.114 

Beginning  in  mid-March 2016, Unit  26165  had  primary  responsibility  for  hacking  the 
DCCC and DNC, as well as email accounts of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign: 115

to these networks,  indicating  that the  later DCCC and  DNC  intrusions  were  not  crimes of 
opportunity but rather the result of targeting. 116 

GRU  officers  also  sent hundreds  of spearphishing  emails  to  the  work  and  personal  email 
accounts of Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers.  Between March 10, 2016 and March 
15, 2016,  Unit 26165  appears to  have sent approximately 90  spearphishing emails to  email 
accounts at hillaryclinton.com.  Starting on March 15, 2016, the GRU began targeting Google 
email accounts used by Clinton Campaign employees, along with a smaller number of dnc.org 
email accounts. 117 

The GRU spearphishing operation enabled it to gain access to numerous email accounts of 
Clinton Campaign employees and volunteers, including campaign chairman John Podesta, junior 
volunteers  assigned  to  the  Clinton  Campaign's  advance  team,  informal  Clinton  Campaign 
advisors,  and  a  DNC  employee. 118  GRU  officers  stole  tens  of  thousands  of  emails  from 
spearphishing victims, including various Clinton Campaign-related communications.

2.  Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks 

a.  Initial Access 

By  no  later  than  April  12,  2016,  the  GRU  had  gained  access  to  the  DCCC  computer 
network  using  the  credentials  stolen  from  a  DCCC  employee  who  had  been  successfully 
spearphished  the  week  before.  Over  the  ensuing  weeks,  the  GRU  traversed  the  network, 
identifying different computers  connected  to  the  DCCC  network.  By stealing  network  access 
credentials  along the  way  (including those  of IT administrators  with unrestricted access  to  the 
system), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network. 119 

Approximately six days after first hacking into  the  DCCC network,  on  April  18,  2016, 
GRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection120 
between the DCCC and DNC networks. 121  Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165 
compromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and 
shared file server. 122 

b.  Implantation of Ma/ware on DCCC and DNC Networks 

Unit  26165  implanted  on  the  DCCC  and  DNC  networks  two  types  of customized 
malware, 123  known as  "X-Agent" and "X-Tunnel";  Mimikatz,  a  credential-harvesting tool;  and 
rar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration.  X-Agent 
was a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and 
gather other data about the  infected computers  (e.g.,  file  directories,  operating systems). 124  X(cid:173)
Tunnel was a  hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC 
computers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable 
of large-scale data transfers. 125  GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the 
victim computers. 

120  A  VPN  extends  a  private  network,  allowing  users  to  send  and  receive  data  across  public 
networks (such as the internet) as if the connecting computer was directly connected to the private network. 
The  VPN in this  case  had  been created to give a  small  number  of DCCC  employees  access  to  certain 
databases housed on the DNC network.  Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC's 
private network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers.

To operate X-Agent and X-Tunnel on the DCCC and DNC networks, Unit 26165 officers 
set  up  a  group  of computers  outside  those  networks  to  communicate  with  the  implanted 
malware. 126  The first set of GRU-controlled computers, known by the GRU as "middle servers," 
sent  and  received  messages  to  and  from  malware  on  the  DNC/DCCC  networks.  The  middle 
servers, in turn, relayed messages to a second set of GRU-controlled com;§'ters, labeled internally 
by the GRU as an "AMS Panel."  The AMS Panel jjjff 11'•§\1flffl  1•j'1·-

The  Arizona-based  AMS  Panel  also  stored  thousands  of files  containing  keylogging 
sessions captured through  X-Agent.  These sessions were captured as  GRU  officers  monitored 
DCCC and DNC employees' work on infected computers regularly between April 2016 and June 
2016.  Data captured in these key logging sessions included passwords, internal communications 
between employees, banking information, and sensitive personal information. 

c.  Theft of Documents from DNC and DCCC Networks 

Officers  from  Unit  26165  stole  thousands  of documents  from  the  DCCC  and  DNC 
networks,  including  significant amounts  of data pertaining to  the 2016  U.S.  federal  elections. 
Stolen documents included internal strategy documents, fundraising data, opposition research, and 
emails from the work inboxes of DNC employeesY0 

The GRU began stealing DCCC data shortly after it gained access to the network.  On April 
14, 2016 (approximately three  days after the initial  intrusion) GRU officers downloaded rar.exe 
onto  the  DCCC's document  server.  The  following  day,  the  GRU  searched  one  compromised 
DCCC computer for files  containing search terms that included "Hillary," "DNC,"  "Cruz," and 
"Trump." 131  On April 25, 2016, the GRU collected and compressed PDF and Microsoft documents 
from folders  on the DCCC' s shared file  server that pertained to the 2016 election.132  The GRU 
appears to have compressed and exfiltrated over 70 gigabytes of data from this file server.133 

The GRU also stole documents from the DNC network shortly after gaining access.  On

Unit 26165 officers appear to have stolen thousands of emails and attachments, which were later 
released by WikiLeaks in July 2016. 136 

B.  Dissemination of the Hacked Materials 

The  GRU' s  operations  extended  beyond  stealing  materials,  and  included  releasing 
documents  stolen  from  the  Clinton  Campaign  and  its  supporters.  The  GRU  carried  out  the 
anonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created-DCLeaks and Guccifer 
2.0-and later through the organization WikiLeaks. 

1.  DCLeaks 

The GRU began planning the releases at least as early as April 19, 2016, when Unit 26165 
registered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant.137  Unit 26165 
paid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined. 138  The dcleaks.com landing page 
pointed  to  different tranches of stolen documents,  arranged  by victim or subject matter.  Other 
dcleaks.com pages contained  indexes of the  stolen emails that were being released (bearing the 
sender, recipient, and date of the email).  To control access and the timing of releases, pages were 
sometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public. 

Starting  in June 2016,  the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com, 
including documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign. 
These documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular, Google 
and Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks.  DCLeaks victims 
included an advisor to the Clinton Campaign,  a  former  DNC employee and Clinton Campaign 
employee,  and  four  other  campaign  volunteers. 139  The  GRU  released  through  dcleaks.com 
thousands  of  documents,  including  personal  identifying  and  financial  information,  internal 
correspondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and 
information. 140 

136  Netyksho Indictment ,i 29. The last-in-time DNC email released by WikiLeaks was dated May 
25,  2016,  the  same  period  of time  during  which  the  GRU  gained  access  to  the  DNC's  email  server.

GRU officers operated a Facebook page under the DCLeaks moniker, which they primarily 
used to promote releases  of materials. 141  The  Facebook page was administered through a  small 
number of preexisting GRU-controlled Facebook accounts. 142 

GRU officers also used the DCLeaks Facebook account,  the Twitter account @dcleaks_, 
and  the email  account dcleaksproject@gmail.com to communicate privately with reporters  and 
· other U.S.  persons.  GRU officers using the DCLeaks persona gave certain reporters early access 
to  archives  of leaked  files  by  sending them  links  and  passwords to  pages  on the  dcleaks.com 
website that had not yet become public.  For example, on July 14, 2016, GRU officers operating 
under the DCLeaks persona sent a link and password for a non-public DCLeaks webpage to a U.S. 
reporter  via the  Facebook  account. 143  Similarly,  on  September  14,  2016,  GRU  officers  sent 
reporters Twitter direct messages from @dcleaks_, with a password to another non-public part of 
the dcleaks.com website. 144 

The DCLeaks.com website remained operational and public until March 2017. 

2.  Guccifer 2.0 

On June 14, 2016, the DNC and its cyber-response team announced the breach of the DNC 
network  and  suspected  theft of DNC  documents.  In  the  statements,  the  cyber-response  team 
alleged  that  Russian  state-sponsored  actors  (which  they  referred  to  as  "Fancy  Bear")  were 
responsible for the  breach. 145  Apparently  in  response to that announcement, on June  15, 2016, 
GRU officers using the persona Guccifer 2.0 created a WordPress blog.  In the hours leading up 
to the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and 
managed  by  Unit 74455  and  searched  for  a  number  of specific  words  and phrases  in  English, 
including  "some  hundred  sheets," "illuminati,"  and  "worldwide  known."  Approximately  two 
hours  after the last of those searches,  Guccifer 2.0  published its first  post,  attributing the DNC 
server hack to a lone Romanian hacker and using several of the unique English words and phrases 
that the GRU officers had searched for that day. 146

U.S. Department of Justice 

That same day, June 15, 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 WordPress blog to begin 
releasing  to  the  public  documents  stolen  from  the  DNC  and  DCCC  computer  networks.  The 
Guccifer 2.0 persona ultimately released thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC 
in  a  series of blog posts between June  15, 2016 and October 18, 2016. 147  Released  documents 
included  opposition  research  performed  by  the  DNC  (including  a  memorandum  analyzing 
potential criticisms of candidate Trump), internal policy documents (such as recommendations on 
how  to  address  politically  sensitive  issues),  analyses  of  specific  congressional  races,  and 
fundraising documents.  Releases were organized around thematic  issues,  such as specific states 
(e.g., Florida and Pennsylvania) that were perceived as competitive in the 2016 U.S. presidential 
election. 

Beginning  in  late  June  2016,  the  GRU  also  used  the  Guccifer  2.0  persona  to  release 
documents directly to reporters and other interested individuals.  Specifically, on June 27, 2016, 
Guccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide "exclusive 
access to  some  leaked  emails  linked  [to]  Hillary  Clinton's  staff." 148  The  GRU  later  sent the 
reporter a password  and  link to  a  locked  portion  of the  dcleaks.com website that contained an 
archive of emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016. 149  That 
the Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters access to a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website 
tends  to  indicate  that  both  personas  were  operated  by  the  same  or  a  closely-related  group  of 
people.1so 

The  GRU  continued  its  release  efforts  through  Guccifer  2.0  into  August  2016.  For 
example,  on August  15,  2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a  candidate for the U.S.  Congress 
documents related to the candidate's opponent.1st  On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona 
transferred approximately 2.5  gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from  the DCCC to  a U.S. 
blogger covering Florida politics. 1s2  On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S. 
reporter documents stolen from the DCCC pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement.1s3 

147  Releases of documents on the Guccifer 2.0 blog occurred on June  15, 2016; June 20, 2016; June 
21, 2016; July  6, 2016; July  14, 2016; August 12, 2016; August 15, 2016; August 21,  2016; August 31,

3.  Use of WikiLeaks 

In order to expand its  interference in the 20 I 6  U.S. presidential election, the  GRU  units 
transferred  many  of the  documents  they  stole  from the  DNC and the chairman  of the  Clinton 
Campaign to  WikiLeaks.  GRU  officers  used  both the DCLeaks  and Guccifer 2.0  personas to 
communicate with WikiLeaks through Twitter private messaging and through encrypted channels, 
including possibly through WikiLeaks ' s private communication system. 

.  a.  WikiLeaks's Expressed Opposition Toward the Clinton Campaign 

WikiLeaks, and particularly its founder Julian Assange, privately expressed opposition to 
candidate Clinton well before the first release of stolen documents.  In November 2015, Assange 
wrote to other members and associates of WikiLeaks that "[w]e believe it would be much better 
for GOP to win ... Dems+Media+liberals woudl  [sic]  then form  a  block to reign in their worst 
qualities. . . .  With  Hillary  in  charge,  GOP  will  be  pushing  for  her  worst  qualities., 
dems+media+neoliberals will be mute . ... She' s a bright, well connected, sadisitic sociopath." 156 

In March 2016, WikiLeaks released a searchable archive of approximately 30,000 Clinton 
emails  that  had  been  obtained  through  FOIA  litigation. 157  While  designing  the  archive,  one 
WikiLeaks member explained the reason for building the archive to another associate:

annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US 
election, because eit [sic] may en[]courage people to send us even more important leaks. 158 

b.  WikiLeaks's First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks 

Shortly  after  the  GRU's first  release  of stolen  documents  through  dcleaks.com  in  June 
2016,  GRU  officers  also  used  the  DCLeaks  persona  to  contact  WikiLeaks  about  possible 
coordination in the future  release of stolen emails.  On June  14, 2016, @dcleaks _  sent a  direct 
message  to  @WikiLeaks, noting,  "You announced  your organization was  preparing to  publish 
more Hillary's emails.  We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in 
particular,  her financial documents. Let's do it to  ether. What do  ou think about  ublishin  our 
info  at the  same  moment?  Thank  ou."159 

Around  the  same  time,  WikiLeaks  initiated  communications  with  the  GRU  persona 
Guccifer 2.0 shortly after it  was  used to  release documents  stolen from the DNC.  On  June  22, 
2016, seven days  after Guccifer 2.0's first releases  of stolen DNC documents,  WikiLeaks  used 
Twitter's  direct message  function  to  contact the  Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account  and  suggest that 
Guccifer 2.0 "[s]end any new material [stolen from the DNC] here for us to review and it will have 
a much higher impact than what you are doing." 160 

On  July  6,  2016,  WikiLeaks  again  contacted  Guccifer  2.0  through  Twitter's  private 
messaging function, writing, "if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] 
days prefab le  [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind 
her after."  The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, "ok ... i see."  WikiLeaks also explained, "we 
think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary ... so conflict between bernie and 
hillary is interesting." 161 

c.  The GRU's Transfer of Stolen Materials to WikiLeaks 

Both the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications, which has limited the 
Office's ability to collect all of the communications between them.  Thus, although it is clear that 
the stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from the GRU to WikiLeaks, -

The Office was able to identify when the GRU ( operating through its personas Guccifer 2.0 
and DCLeaks) transferred some of the stolen documents to WikiLeaks through online archives set 
up by the  GRU.  Assan  e  had access to the internet from the Ecuadorian Embass 
in London,

On July 14, 2016, GRU officers used a Guccifer 2.0 email account to send WikiLeaks an 
email bearing the subject "big archive" and the message "a new attempt."163  The email contained 
an encrypted attachment with the name "wk dnc link I .txt.gpg."164  Using the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter 
account, GRU officers sent WikiLeaks an encrypted file and instructions on how to open it.165  On 
July  18,  2016, WikiLeaks confirmed in a  direct message to the  Gucci fer 2.0 account that it had 
"the  1 Gb  or so archive"  and would make a  release of the stolen documents "this week." 166  On 
July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 20,000 emails and other documents stolen from the DNC 
computer networks. 167  The Democratic National Convention began three days later. 

Similar  communications  occurred  between  WikiLeaks  and  the  GRU-operated  persona 
DCLeaks.  On  September  15,  2016,  @dcleaks  wrote to  @WikiLeaks,  "hi there!  I'm  from  DC

your secured chat but getting no response.  I've got something that might interest you. You won't 
be disappointed,  I promise." 168  The WikiLeaks account responded,  "Hi there," without further 
elaboration.  The @dcleaks_ account did not respond immediately.

Guccifer  2.0  persona  informed  DCLeaks  that  WikiLeaks was  trying to  contact DCLeaks  and 
arrange for a way to speak through encrypted emails. 170 

An analysis  of the  metadata collected from  the  WikiLeaks  site revealed  that the  stolen 
Podesta  emails  show  a  creation  date  of September  19,  2016. 171  Based  on  information  about 
Assange's computer and its possible operating system, this date may be when the GRU staged the 
stolen Podesta emails for transfer to WikiLeaks (as the GRU had previously done in July 2016 for 
the DNC emails). 172  The  WikiLeaks  site  also  released  PDFs  and  other documents  taken  from 
Podesta that were attachments to  emails in his account; these  documents had a  creation date of 
October  2,  2016,  which  appears  to  be  the  date  the  attachments  were  separately  staged  by 
WikiLeaks on its site. 173 

Beginning on September 20, 2016, WikiLeaks and DCLeaks resumed communications in 
a brief exchange.  On September 22, 2016, a DCLeaks email account dcleaksproject@gmail.com

On October 7, 2016,  WikiLeaks released the first emails  stolen from  the Podesta  email 
account.  In total, WikiLeaks released 33 tranches of stolen emails between October 7, 2016 and 
November  7,  2016.  The  releases  included  private  speeches  given  by  Clinton; 177  internal 
communications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign; 178 
and correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation.179  In total, WikiLeaks released over 50,000 
documents stolen from Podesta' s personal email account.  The last-in-time  email released from 
Podesta' s  account was  dated  March  21,  2016, two  days  after  Podesta received a  spearphishing 
email sent by the GRU. 

d.  WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials 

As  reports  attributing the DNC  and DCCC  hacks  to  the Russian  government emerged, 
WikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source 
of the materials that WikiLeaks was  releasing.  The file-transfer  evidence described above  and 
other  information  uncovered  during  the  investigation  discredit  WikiLeaks's  claims  about  the 
source of material that it posted. 

Beginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements 
about Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016.  The statements about 
Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails.  On August 9, 2016, 
the  @WikiLeaks  Twitter  account  posted:  "ANNOUNCE:  WikiLeaks  has  decided  to  issue  a 
US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder ofDNC staffer Seth Rich." 180 
Likewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, "Why are you so  interested in 
Seth Rich's killer?" and responded, "We're very interested in anything  that might be a threat to 
alleged Wikileaks sources."  The interviewer responded to Assange' s statement by commenting, 
" I know you don' t want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you're suggesting a man 
who leaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered."  Assange replied, "If there' s someone 
who's potentially connected to  our publication, and that person has been murdered  in suspicious

circumstances,  it doesn't necessarily  mean that the two  are  connected.  But it is  a  very  serious 
matter ... that type of allegation is very serious, as it's taken very seriously by us." 181 

After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was 
behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released  by 
WikiLeaks  had  come from Russian hacking.  According to media reports, Assange told  a  U.S. 
congressman that the DNC hack was an "inside job," and purported to have "physical proof' that 
Russians did not give materials to Assange. 182 

C.  Additional GRU Cyber Operations 

While  releasing  the  stolen  emails  and  documents  through  DCLeaks,  Guccifer 2.0,  and 
WikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign 
and, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states. 

1.  Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims 

On July 27  2016, Unit 26165  targeted  email  accounts connected to  candidate Clinton's 
personal office 
.  Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public  statements that 
included the following:  "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to  find the 30,000 emails 
that are missing.  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by  our press." 183  The "30,000 
emails" were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored 
on a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State. 

Within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first 
time Clinton's personal office.  After candidate Trump's remarks, Unit  26165  created and sent 
malicious  links  targeting  15  email  accounts  at the  domain 
including  an  email 
account belonging to Clinton aide 
The investigation did not find evidence of earlier 
GRU  attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain.  It is  unclear how the GRU was 
able to identify these email accounts, which were not public. 184 

Unit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service 
On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate 
function designed to allow users to produce backups of 
as "snapshots").  The GRU then stole those snapshots by moving 

copies of the DNC da 
databases (referred to

controlled computers.  The GRU stole approximately 300 gigabytes of data from the DNC cloud(cid:173)
based account. 185 

2.  Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections 

In addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also 
targeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections.  Victims included 
U.S.  state and local entities, such as  state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and 
county  governments,  as  well  as  individuals  who  worked  for  those  entities. 186  The  GRU  also 
targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related 
software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187  The 
GRU  continued  to  target these  victims  through  the  elections  in  November  2016.  While  the 
investigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office 
did  not  investigate further.  The Office did not, for  instance,  obtain or examine servers or other 
relevant  items  belonging  to  these  victims.  The  Office  understands  that  the  FBI,  the  U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. 

By at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer 
networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental 
entities.  GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a 
technique  known as  "SQL  injection,"  by  which  malicious  code  was  sent to the  state  or  local 
website in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents). 188  In one instance 
in approximately June 2016, the  GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois  State 
Board of Elections by exploiting a  vulnerability in the SBOE's website.  The GRU then gained 
access  to  a  database  containing  information  on  millions  of registered  Illinois  voters, 189  and 
extracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified. 190

for vulnerabilities continued through the election. 

Unit  74455  also  sent  spearphishing  emails  to  public  officials  involved  in  election 
administration and personnel a~  involved in voting technology.  In August 2016, GRU 
officers targeted employees of . . . . .  , a voting technology company that developed software 
used  by  numerous  U.S.  counties to  manage voter rolls,  and  installed  malware  on  the  company 
network.  Similarly,  in  November 2016, the  GRU  sent spearphishing  emails to  over  120  email 
accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election. 191 
The spearphishing emails contained an attached Word document coded with malicious software 
(commonly referred to  as  a Trojan) that permitted the GRU  to  access  the  infected computer.192 
The FBI was separately responsible for this investigation. We understand the FBI believes that this 
operation  enabled  the  GRU  to  gain  access  to  the  network  of  at  least  one  Florida  county 
government.  The Office did not independently verify that belief and, as explained above, did not 
undertake the investigative steps that would have been necessary to do so.

d.  WikiLeaks's October 7,  2016 Release of Stolen Podesta Emails 

On October 7  2016  four days after the Assange press conference 

, the Washington Post published an Access Hollywood video that 
captured  comments by candidate Trump some years earlier and that was  expected to  adversely 
affect the Campaign.239  Less than an hour after the video's publication, WikiLeaks released the 
first  set  of  emails  stolen  by  the  GRU  from  the  account  of  Clinton  Campaign  chairman 
John Podesta.

that he  believed Malloch was on the  call but then focused 
on other individuals who were on the call-invitation, which Malloch was not.  (Separate travel records show 
that at the time of the  call, Malloch was aboard a transatlantic flight).  Corsi at one point stated that after 
WikiLeaks 's release of stolen emails on October 7, 2016, he concluded Malloch had gotten in contact with 
Assange.  Corsi 11/1/18 302, at 6.

enormous and recalled telling the conference call the Access Hollywood tape was coming.245  Corsi 
stated that he was convinced that his efforts had caused WikiLeaks to release the emails when they 
did.246  In a later November 2018 interview, Corsi stated that he thought that he had told people 
on a  WND conference call about the forthcoming tape and had sent out a tweet asking whether 
anyone could contact Assange, but then said that maybe he had done nothing.247 

The Office investigated Corsi' s allegations about the events of October 7 

little  corroboration for  his alle  ations  about the  da  .248 

However,  the phone records 
themselves  do  not indicate  that the conversation was  with  any  of the  reporters  who  broke the 
Access Hollywood sto 
, and the Office has not otherwise been able to identif  the substance of 
the conversation. 

However, the Office 
has not identified any conference call participant, or anyone who spoke to Corsi that day, who says 
that they received  non-public  information  about the  tape  from  Corsi  or acknowledged having 
contacted a member of WikiLeaks on October 7, 2016 after a conversation with Corsi. 

e.  Donald Trump Jr.  Interaction with  WikiLeaks 

Donald  Trump  Jr.  had  direct  electronic  communications  with  WikiLeaks  during  the 
campaign period.  On September 20, 2016,  an  individual named Jason Fishbein sent WikiLeaks 
the password for an unlaunched website focused on Trump's "unprecedented and dangerous" ties 

245 During the same interview, Corsi also suggested that he may have sent out public tweets because 

he knew Assange was reading his tweets.  Our Office was unable to find evidence of any such tweets.

Several hours later, WikiLeaks sent a Twitter direct message to Donald Trump Jr., "A PAC run

have  guessed  the  password.  It  is  'putintrump.'  See  'About'  for  who  is  behind  it.  Any 
comments ?"253 

Several hours later, Trump Jr. emailed a variety of senior campaign staff: 

Guys I  got a  weird Twitter DM from  wikileaks.  See  below.  I  tried  the  password and  it 
works and the about section they reference contains the next pie in terms of who is behind

Trump Jr. attached a screenshot of the "About" page for the unlaunched site PutinTrump.org.  The

2.  Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials 

Throughout 2016,  the  Trump  Campaign  expressed  interest  in  Hillary  Clinton's  private 
email  server  and  whether  approximately  30,000  emails  from  that  server  had  in  fact  been 
permanently  destroyed,  as  reported  by  the  media.  Several  individuals  associated  with  the 
Campaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and 
other stolen material  in support of the Trump Campaign.  Some of these contacts were met with 
sk~pticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree.  The investigation did 
not find  evidence  that  the Trump  Campaign  recovered  any  s~ch  Clinton  emails,  or that  these 
contacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign. 

a.  Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg) 

In the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Florida(cid:173)
based Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also 
went by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton. 
Caputo  notified  Roger  Stone  and  brokered  communication  between  Stone  and  Oknyansky. 
Oknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting.260 

Oknyansky  was  accompanied  to  the  meeting  by  Alexei  Rasin,  a  Ukrainian  associate 
involved in Florida real estate.  At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information 
on Clinton that Rasin  claimed  to have  obtained  while  working for  Clinton.  Rasin  claimed to 
possess  financial  statements  demonstrating  Clinton's  involvement  in  money  laundering  with 
Rasin's  companies.  According to  Oknyansky,  Stone  asked  if the amounts  in  question totaled 
millions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands.  Stone refused the offer, 
stating that Trump would not pay for opposition research.261 

Oknyansky  claimed to  the  Office  that Rasin's  motivation  was  financial.  According  to 
Oknyansky,  Rasin  had  tried  unsuccessfully  to  shop  the  Clinton  information  around  to  other 
interested parties,  and  Oknyansky would receive  a  cut if the  information was  sold.262  Rasin  is 
noted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida 
companies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton.  The Office found no other evidence 
that Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities. 

In their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections 
about  the  meeting.  Oknyansky  claimed  that  Caputo  accompanied  Stone  to  the  meeting  and 
provided an  introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he 
was  never told  what  information  Oknyansky offered.  Caputo  also stated that he was  unaware 
Oknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.263

The Office did not locate Rasin in the United States, although the Office confirmed Rasin 
had been  issued  a  Florida driver's  license.  The Office otherwise was  unable  to  determine  the 
content and origin of the information he purportedly offered to  Stone.  Finally, the investigation 
did  not  identify  evidence  of a  connection  between  the  outreach  or  the  meeting  and  Russian 
interference efforts. 

b.  Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails 

After  candidate  Trump  stated  on  July  27,  2016,  that he  hoped  Russia  would  "find  the 
30,000 emails that are missing," Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the 
deleted Clinton emails.264  Michael Flynn-who would later serve as National Security Advisor in 
the  Trump  Administration-
recalled  that  Trump  made  this  request  repeatedly,  and  Flynn 
subsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.265 

Barbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn.  Ledeen, a 
long-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn 
about her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266  Smith, an investment advisor who was active 
in Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails.267 

Ledeen began her efforts to  obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn's request, as early as 
December 2015.268  On December 3, 2015, she  emailed  Smith a proposal to  obtain the emails, 
stating,  "Here is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be 
happy to talk with you either in person or over the phone.  The person can get the emails which  1. 
Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies.  That would demonstrate what needs to be 
demonstrated."269 

Attached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the "Clinton email server was, in 
all likelihood, breached long ago," and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services 
could "re-assemble the server's email content."270  The proposal called for a three-phase approach. 
The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis.  The third phase consisted of checking with 
certain intelligence sources "that have access through liaison work with various foreign services" 
to determine  if any of those services had gotten to  the server.  The  proposal noted, "Even  if a 
single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would 
be  catastrophic to the Clinton  campaign[.]"  Smith  forwarded  the  email to  two  colleagues and

wrote, "we can discuss to whom it should be referred."271  On December 16, 2015, Smith informed 
Ledeen that he declined to  participate in her "initiative."  According to one of Smith's business 
associates, Smith believed Ledeen's initiative was not viable at that time.272 

Just weeks after Trump's July 2016 request to find  the Clinton emails,  however,  Smith 
tried to  locate and obtain the emails himself.  He created a  company, raised tens of thousands of 
dollars,  and  recruited  security  experts  and  business  associates.  Smith  made  claims  to  others 
involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers 
with  "ties  and  affiliations  to  Russia"  who  had  access  to  the  emails,  and  that his  efforts  were 
coordinated with the Trump Campaign.273 

On August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject "Sec. 
Clinton's unsecured private email server" to an undisclosed list ofrecipients, including Campaign 
co-chairman Sam Clovis.  The email stated that Smith was " u]ust finishing two days of sensitive 
meetings here  in DC with  involved groups to  poke and probe on the above.  It  is  clear that the 
Clinton's home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and 
private mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election."274 

On September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC 
in furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails.275  One of the purposes ofKLS Research 
was to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative.276  KLS Research received over 
$30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more 
money.277 

Smith recruited multiple people for his  initiative, including security experts to search for 
and authenticate the emails.278  In early September 2016, as pait of his recruitment and fundraising 
effort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was "in coordination" with the Trump 
Campaign, "to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization."279  The document 
listed multiple individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, including Flynn, Clovis, Bannon,

and Kellyanne Conway.280  The investigation established that Smith communicated with at least 
Flynn and Clovis about his search for the deleted Clinton emails,281  but the Office did not identify 
evidence that any of the listed individuals initiated or directed Smith's efforts. 

In  September  2016,  Smith and  Ledeen  got  back  in  touch  with  each  other  about  their 
respective efforts.  Ledeen wrote to Smith, "wondering if you had some more detailed reports or 
memos or other data you could share because we have come a  long way in our efforts since we 
last visited ... . We would need  as much technical discussion as possible  so  we could marry  it 
against the new data we have found and then could share it back to you 'your eyes only.'"282 

Ledeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the "dark 
web") that purpo1ted to be the deleted Clinton emails.  Ledeen wanted to  authenticate the emails 
and solicited contributions to fund that effort.  Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor 
to ascertain the authenticity of the emails.  According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that 
the emails were not authentic.283 

A  backup  of Smith's  computer  contained  two  files  that  had  been  downloaded  from 
WikiLeaks  and that were  originally attached to  emails received  by  John Podesta.  The files  on 
Smith's computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release 
by WikiLeaks.  Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect 
when the  files  were downloaded to Smith' s  computer.  (It appears  the creation date  was  when 
WikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.284
) 
The  investigation did  not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the  files  before  their 
release by WikiLeaks. 

Smith continued to  send emails  to  an  undisclosed  recipient  list about  Clinton' s  deleted 
emails until shortly before the election.  For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there 
was a "tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,"  and 
that WikiLeaks "has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this 
allows little time for response  prior to  the U.S.  election November  8."285  An attachment to the

Office tested this theory  in March 2019  by  downloading the two  files  found  on Smith's  computer from 
WikiLeaks's site using the same Apple operating system on Smith's computer; both files were successfully 
downloaded and retained the October 2, 2016 creation date.  See SM-2284941, serial 62.

email claimed that WikiLeaks would release "All 33k deleted Emails" by "November 1st."  No 
emails obtained from Clinton's server were subsequently released. 

Smith  drafted  multiple  emails  stating or  intimating that  he was in contact with  Russian 
hackers.  For example, in one such email, Smith claimed that, in August 2016, KLS Research had 
organized meetings  with parties who had access to the deleted Clinton emails,  including parties 
with "ties and affiliations to Russia."286 The investigation did not identify evidence that any such 
meetings occurred.  Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on the initiative did 
not  believe  that  Smith  was  in  contact  with  Russian  hackers  and  were  aware  of  no  such 
connection.287  The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers 
or that Smith, Ledeen, or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaign ultimately obtained 
the deleted Clinton emails. 

* * * 

In sum, the investigation established that the GRU hacked into email accounts of persons 
affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, as well as the computers of the DNC and DCCC.  The GRU 
then  exfiltrated  data  related  to  the  2016  election  from  these  accounts  and  computers,  and 
disseminated that data through fictitious  online personas (DCLeaks  and Guccifer 2.0)  and later 
through  WikiLeaks.  The  investigation  also  established  that  the  Trum  Cam  ai  n  dis  la  ed 
interest in the WikiLeaks releases, and that 

explained  in  Volume  I,  Section  V.B,  infra,  the  evidence  was  sufficient to  support computer(cid:173)

IV.  RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS To AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN 

The Office identified multiple contacts-"links," in the words of the Appointment Order(cid:173)

between Trump  Campaign officials  and  individuals with  ties  to the Russian government.  The 
Office  investigated  whether  those  contacts  constituted  a  third  avenue  of attempted  Russian 
interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election.  In  particular, the  investigation 
examined  whether these contacts  involved or resulted  in  coordination or a  conspiracy with the 
Trump  Campaign  and  Russia,  including  with  respect  to  Russia  providing  assistance  to  the 
Campaign in  exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in  the future.  Based on the available 
information, the investigation did not establish such coordination. 

This Section describes the principal  links between the Trump Campaign and  individuals 
with ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates 
that  have  been publicly reported  to  involve Russian contacts.  Each  subsection begins  with  an 
overview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are 
generally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and 
extending through the post-election, transition period. 

A.  Campaign Period (September 2015 - November 8, 2016) 

Russian-government-connected individuals  and media entities  began showing interest in 
Trump' s  campaign  in  the  months  after  he  announced  his  candidacy  in June  2015.288  Because 
Trump's status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and 
entertainment dealings,  this  Office  investigated  whether a  business  contact with  Russia-linked 
individuals  and  entities  during  the  campaign  period-the Trump  Tower  Moscow  project,  see 
Volume l, Section IV.A. I, infra-led to or involved coordination of election assistance. 

Outreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016, 
when  Trump  was  moving  toward- and  eventually  becoming-the  Republican  nominee  for 
President.  As  set forth  below,  the  Office  also  evaluated  a  series  of links  during  this  period: 
outreach  to  two  of  Trump's  then-recently  named  foreign  policy  advisors,  including  a 
representation  that Russia had "dirt" on Clinton  in the  form  of thousands  of emails  (Volume I, 
Sections IV.A.2 &  IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and 
has  connections  with  its  government (Volume  I,  Section  IV.A.4);  a  meeting  at  Trump  Tower 
between the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was "part of 
Russia  and  its  government's  support  for  [Trump]"  (Volume  I,  Section  IV.A.5);  events  at the 
Republican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between 
Trump  Campaign  officials  and  Russia's  ambassador  to  the  United  States  (Volume  I,  Section 
IV.A.7); and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for 
a Russian oligarch and a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine (Volume I, Section IV.A.8). 

288  For example,  on August  18, 2015, on  behalf of the  editor-in-chief of the  internet newspaper 
Vzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press  secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phone or in-person 
candidate interview.  8/18/15  Email, Asatryan to  Hicks.  One day  earlier, the publication's founder  (and 
former Russian parliamentarian) Konstantin Rykov had registered two Russian websites-Trump2016.ru 
and DonaldTrump2016.ru.  No interview took place.

1.  Trump Tower Moscow Project 

The Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as 
part  of its  real  estate  portfolio.  Some  projects  have  involved  the  acquisition  and  ownership 
(through subsidiary corporate structures) of property.  In other cases, the Trump Organization has 
executed licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies, often local to the 
country where the project was located.289 

Between at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal 
in  Russia  involving  the  construction  of a  Trump-branded  property  in  Moscow.  The  project, 
commonly referred to as  a "Trump Tower Moscow" or "Trump Moscow" project, anticipated a 
combination  of  commercial,  hotel,  and  residential  properties  all  within  the  same  building. 
Between  2013  and  June  2016,  several  employees of the  Trump  Organization,  including  then(cid:173)
president  of the  organization  Donald  J.  Trump,  pursued  a  Moscow  deal  with  several  Russian 
counterparties.  From the fall of 2015  until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the 
Trump Organization's pursuit of a  Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the 
project's status to candidate Trump and other executives in the Trump Organization.290 

a.  Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014) 

The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group, a Russian real estate conglomerate owned 
and controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-based real estate project shortly after 
the conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.291  Donald J. Trump Jr. served as 
_the  primary  negotiator  on  behalf  of the  Trump  Organization;  Emin  Agalarov  (son  of Aras 
Agalarov) and Irakli "Ike" Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations,292  with 
the occasional assistance of Robe1t Goldstone.293 

In December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of 

289 See,  e.g., Interview of Donald J  Trump, Jr,  Senate Judiciary Committee,  115th Cong.  151-52 

(Sept. 7, 2017) ( discussing licensing deals of specific projects). 

290  As  noted  in  Volume  I,  Section  III.D.l,  supra,  in November 2018,  Cohen pleaded  guilty  to 
making false  statements to  Congress  concerning, among other things, the duration of the  Trump  Tower 
Moscow project.  See Information ,r 7(a), United States v. Michael Cohen, 1 :18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 
2018), Doc. 2 ("Cohen Information"). 

291  See Interview of Donald J  Trump,  Jr,  Senate Judiciary Committee,  115th Cong.  13 (Sept.  7, 
2017) ("Following the pageant the Trump Organization and Mr. Agalarov' s company, Crocus Group, began 
preliminarily discussion [sic] potential real estate projects in Moscow.").  As has been widely reported, the 
Miss  Universe  pageant-which Trump co-owned _at the time-was held  at the  Agalarov-owned  Crocus 
City Hall in Moscow in November 2013.  Both groups were involved in organizing the pageant, and Aras 
Agalarov's son Emin was a musical performer at the event, which Trump attended.

an agreement for the Trump Tower Moscow project.294  On December 23, 2013, after discussions 
with Donald J.  Trump,  the  Trump  Organization  agreed  to  accept an  arrangement whereby  the 
organization received a flat 3.5% commission on all sales, with no licensing fees or incentives.295 
The parties negotiated a letter of intent during January and February 2014.296 

From January 2014 through November 2014, the Trump Organization and Crocus Group 
discussed development plans for the Moscow project.  Some time before January 24, 2014, the 
Crocus  Group sent the Trump Organization a  proposal for a  800-unit,  194-meter building to  be  · 
constructed at an Agalarov-owned site in Moscow called "Crocus City," which had also been the 
site of the Miss Universe pageant.297  In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov 
and toured the Crocus City site during a visit to Moscow.298  From March 2014 through July 2014, 
the groups discussed "design standards" and other architectural elements.299  For example, in July 
2014, members of the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the 
"demographics  of  these  prospective  buyers"  in  the  Crocus  City  area,  the  development  of 
neighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portions of the building.300  In 
August 2014, the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded 
tower being built in Crocus City.301 

Beginning  in  September 2014, the Trump  Organization stopped responding in  a  timely 
fashion to correspondence and proposals from the Crocus Group. 302  Communications between the 
two groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the 
last communication is  dated November 24, 2014.303  The project appears not to  have developed 
past the planning stage, and no construction occurred.

b.  Communications  with  J.C.  Expert  Investment  Company  and  Giorgi 

Rtskhiladze (Summer and Fall 2015) 

In the late summer of 2015, the Trump Organization received a new inquiry about pursuing 
a Trump Tower project in Moscow.  In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New York(cid:173)
based real  estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen,  then-executive vice president of the Trump 
Organization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.304  Sater had previously worked with the 
Trump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects.  Sater had 
explored  the possibility  of a  Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the  Trump 
Organization  and  therefore  knew  of the  organization's  general  interest  in  completing  a  deal 
there.305  Sater  had  also  served  as  an  informal  agent  of the  Trump  Organization  in  Moscow 
previously  and had  accompanied  lvanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr.  to Moscow in the  mid-
2000s.306 

Sater  contacted  Cohen  on  behalf of I.C.  Expert Investment  Company  (LC.  Expert),  a 
Russian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.307  Sater 
had known Rozov  since approximately 2007 and,  in 2014,  had served as  an agent on behalf of 
Rozov during Rozov's purchase of a  building in New York City.308  Sater later contacted Rozov 
and proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which l.C. Expert would 
license the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its  own. 
Sater worked on the deal with Rozov and another.employee of l.C. Expert.309 

Cohen  was  the  only  Trump  Organization  representative  to  negotiate  directly  with  l.C. 
Expert or its agents.  In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with 
I.C.  Expert from candidate  Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization.  Cohen 
provided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him 
the  project was  continuing.31° Cohen  also  discussed  the  Trump  Moscow project with  Ivanka 
Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project311) and Donald J. 
Trump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project312) during the 
fall of 2015.

Also during the fall of 2015, Cohen communicated about the Trump Moscow proposal with 
Giorgi Rtskhiladze, a business executive who previously had been involved in a development deal 
with the Trump Organization in Batumi, Georgia. 313  Cohen stated that he spoke to Rtskhiladze in 
part because Rtskhiladze had pursued business ventures in Moscow, including a licensing deal with 
the Agalarov-owned Crocus Group.314  On September 22, 2015, Cohen forwarded  a preliminary 
design study for the Trump Moscow project to Rtskhiladze, adding "I  look forward to your reply 
about this spectacular project in Moscow."  Rtskhiladze forwarded  Cohen's email to  an associate 
and  wrote, "[i]f we could organize the meeting in New York at the highest level of the  Russian 
Government and Mr. Trump this project would definitely receive the worldwide attention."315 

On  September  24,  2015,  Rtskhiladze  sent  Cohen  an  attachment that  he  described  as  a 
proposed "[!Jetter to the Mayor of Moscow from Trump org," explaining that "[ w ]e need to send 
this letter to the Mayor of Moscow (second guy in Russia) he is aware of the potential project and 
will pledge his support."316  In a second email to Cohen sent the same day, Rtskhiladze provided a 
translation  of the  letter,  which  described  the  Trump  Moscow project as  a  "symbol  of stronger 
economic,  business  and  cultural  relationships  between  New  York  and  Moscow  and  therefore 
United States and the Russian  Federation."317  On September 27, 2015, Rtskhiladze sent another 
email to Cohen, proposing that the Trump Organization partner on the Trump Moscow project with 
"Global Development Group LLC," which he described as being controlled by Michail Posikhin, a 
Russian architect, and Simon Nizharadze. 318  Cohen told the Office that he ultimately declined the 
proposal and instead continued to work with LC. Expert, the company represented by Felix Sater.31 9 

c.  Letter of Intent and Contacts to Russian Government (October 2015-January 

2016) 

i.  Trump Signs the Letter of Intent on behalf of the Trump Organization 

Between approximately October 13, 2015 and November 2, 2015, the Trump Organization 
(through its subsidiary Trump Acquisition, LLC) and I.C. Expert completed a letter of intent (LOI) 
for a Trump Moscow property.  The LOI, signed by Trump for the Trump Organization and Rozov 
on  behalf of I.C.  Expert,  was "intended to  facilitate further discussions"  in order to  "attempt to 

313  Rtskhiladze  was  a  U.S.-based  executive  of the  Georgian  company  Silk  Road  Group. 

In 
approximately 2011 , Silk Road Group and the Trump Organization entered into a licensing agreement to 
build a Trump-branded property in Batumi, Georgia.  Rtskhiladze was also involved in discussions  for a 
Trum  -branded  ro'ect in  Astana,  Kazakhstan.  The  Office  twice  interviewed Rtskhiladze, -

enter into a mutually acceptable agreement" related to the Trump-branded project in Moscow. 320 
The LOI contemplated a development with residential, hotel, commercial, and office components, 
and called for"[ a]pproximately 250 first class, luxury residential condominiums," as well as"[ o ]ne 
first class, luxury hotel consisting of approximately  15  floors and containing not fewer than  150 
hotel  rooms."321 
For  the  residential  and  commercial  portions  of  the  project,  the  Trump 
Organization would receive between 1 % and 5% of all condominium sales,322 plus 3% of all rental 
and other revenue. 323  For the project's hotel portion, the Trump Organization would receive a base 
fee  of 3% of gross operating revenues for the  first five  years  and 4% thereafter, plus a separate 
incentive fee of 20% of operating profit. 324  Under the LOI, the Trump Organization also would 
receive  a  $4 million "up-front fee"  prior to  groundbreaking.325  Under these  terms,  the Trump 
Organization  stood to earn  substantial  sums over the  lifetime  of the project,  without assuming 
significant liabilities or financing commitments.326 

On November 3,  2015,  the day after the  Trump Organization transmitted the LOI,  Sater 
emailed Cohen suggesting that the  Trump Moscow project could be  used to increase candidate 
Trump's chances at being elected, writing: 

Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.  I will get all of 
Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process .... Michael, Putin gets on stage 
with Donald  for  a ribbon  cutting  for  Trump Moscow,  and Donald  owns the  republican 
nomination.  And possibly beats Hillary and our boy is in .. . .  We will manage this process 
better  than  anyone.  You  and  I  will  get Donald  and  Vladimir on a  stage together  very 
shortly.  That the game changer.327 

Later that day, Sater followed up: 

Donald doesn't stare down, he negotiates and understands the economic issues and Putin 
only  want to  deal  with  a  pragmatic  leader,  and  a  successful  business  man  is  a  good 
candidate for someone who knows how to negotiate. "Business, politics, whatever it all is 
the same for someone who knows how to deal"

322 The LOI called for the Trump Organization to receive 5% of all gross sales up to $100 million; 
4% of all  gross sales from  $100 million to $250 million; 3% of all gross sales from $250 million to $500 
million; 2% of all gross sales from  $500 million to $1  billion; and  1 %  of all  gross sales over $1  billion.

According to Cohen, he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project 
to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time.  Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or 
anyone affiliated  with the Trump Campaign discussing the  political  implications  of the Trump 
Moscow project with  him.  However,  Cohen recalled  conversations  with Trump  in  which the 
candidate  suggested that his campaign would  be  a significant "infomercial"  for  Trump-branded 
prope1ties. 329 

ii.  Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia 

Given the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required 
approval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the 
Presidential  Administration  of Russia.330  Sater stated  that  he  therefore  began  to  contact  the 
Presidential Administration through another Russian  business contact.331  In  early  negotiations 
with the  Trump  Organization,  Sater had  alluded  to  the  need  for  government approval  and  his 
attempts to set up meetings with Russian officials.  On October 12, 2015, for example, Sater wrote 
to Cohen that "all we need is Putin on board and we are golden,"  and that a "meeting with Putin 
and top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [ of October]. "332 
this meeting 
was being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian 
government. 333 

Approximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed lvanka 
Trump on behalf of Erchova's then-husband Dmitry  Klokov, to offer Klokov' s assistance to the 
Trump  Campaign.334  Klokov was  at that time  Director of External  Communications for  PJSC 
Federal  Grid  Company  of Unified  Energy  System,  a  large  Russian  electricity  transmission

company, and had been previously employed  as  an aide  and press secretary to  Russia's energy 
minister.  Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.335  He told the Office that, after receiving 
this inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov's name and concluded (incorrectly) 
that Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter. 336 

Between November 18 and 19, 2015,-Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call 
and exchanged several emails.  Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a "trusted person" who 
could  offer  the  Campaign  "political  synergy"  and  "synergy  on  a  government  level,"  Klokov 
recommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified  intermediary. 
Klokov  said  that  those  conversations  could  facilitate  a  later  meeting  in  Russia  between  the 
candidate and an  individual  Klokov described as "our person of interest."337  In  an email to the 
Office, Erchova later identified the "person of interest" as Russian President Vladimir Putin. 338 

In the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use 
a near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local 
developers.  Cohen  registered  his  willingness  also  to  meet  with  Klokov  and  the  unidentified 
intermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump-(cid:173)
including  a  possible  meeting  between  candidate  Trump  and  Putin-would  need  to  be  "in 
conjunction with the development and an official visit" with the Trump Organization receiving a 
formal invitation to  visit. 339  (Klokov had written previously that "the visit [by candidate Trump 
to Russia] has to be informal.")340 

Klokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over 
a possible meeting between Trump and "the person of interest" from any existing business track. 341 
Re-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second 
email to  Cohen that,  if publicized well, such a  meeting could have "phenomenal"  impact "in a 
business dimension"  and that the "person  of interest['s]" "most important support" could  have 
significant ramifications for the "level of projects and their capacity."  Klokov concluded by telling

336 Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 17.  During his interviews with the Office, Cohen still appeared to believe 
that the Klokov he spoke with was that Olympian.  The investigation, however, established that the email 
address used to communicate with Cohen belongs to a different Dmitry Klokov, as described above. 

337  11/18/15 Email, Klokov to Cohen (6:51  a.m.). 
338 In July 2018, the Office received an unsolicited email purporting to be from  Erchova, in which 
she wrote that "[a]t the end of2015 and beginning of2016 I was asked by my ex-husband to contact lvanka 
Trump . .. and  offer cooperation to  Trump's team  on  behalf of the Russian  officials."  7/27/18  Email, 
Erchova to Special Counsel's Office.  The email claimed that the officials wanted to offer candidate Trump 
"land in Crimea among  other things and unofficial meeting with Putin."  Id.  In order to vet the email's 
claims, the Office responded requesting more details.  The Office did not receive any reply.

Cohen that there  was  "no  bigger  warranty  in  any  project than  [the]  consent  of the person  of 
interest."342  Cohen  rejected  the proposal,  saying that "[c]urrently our LOI  developer  is  in talks 
with VP's Chief of Staff and arranging a formal invite for the two to meet."343  This email appears 
to  be  their final  exchange,  and  the  investigation  did  not  identify  evidence  that Cohen  brought 
Klokov' s initial offer of assistance to the Campaign's attention or that anyone associated with the 
Trump Organization or the Campaign dealt with Klokov at a later date.  Cohen explained that he 
did not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with 
Sater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.344 

By late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to 
use those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials.  Cohen 
told Sater that he was "setting up the meeting myself. "345  On January  11, 2016, Cohen emailed 
the office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government's press secretary, indicating that he desired 
contact with  Sergei  Ivanov,  Putin's  chief of staff.  Cohen  erroneously  used  the  email  address 
"Pr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru" instead of "Pr _peskova@prpress.gov .ru," so the  email apparently 
through.346  On  January  14,  2016,  Cohen  emailed  a  different  address 
did  not  go 
(info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message: 

Dear Mr. Peskov, 
Over the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding 
the development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City. 
Without  getting  into  lengthy  specifics,  the  communication  between  our  two  sides  has 
stalled. As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance. 
I  respectfully  request someone,  preferably  you;  contact  me  so  that  I  might discuss  the 
specifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. 
I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.347 

Two days later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak 
with Sergei Ivanov.348 

Cohen testified to Congress, and initially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a 
response to this  email  inquiry  and that he  decided  to  terminate any further  work on the Trump 
Moscow project as of January 2016.  Cohen later admitted that these statements were false.  In

fact,  Cohen had received (and recalled receiving) a  response to his inquiry, and he continued to 
work on and update candidate Trump on the project through as late as June 2016.349 

On January 20, 2016, Cohen received an email from Elena Poliakova, Peskov's personal 
assistant.  Writing from  her personal email account, Poliakova stated that she had been trying to 
reach Cohen and asked that he call her on the personal number that she provided.350  Shortly after 
receiving Poliakova's email, Cohen called and spoke to her for 20 minutes.351  Cohen described to 
Poliakova  his  position  at  the  Trump  Organization  and  outlined  the  proposed  Trump  Moscow 
project, including information about the Russian counterparty with which the Trump Organization 
had partnered.  Cohen requested assistance in moving the project forward, both in securing land to 
build the project and with financing.  According to Cohen, Poliakova asked detailed questions and 
took notes, stating that she would need to follow up with others in Russia.352 

Cohen  could  not  recall  any  direct  follow-up  from  Poliakova  or  from  any  other 
representative  of the  Russian  government,  nor  did  the  Office  identify  any  evidence  of direct 
follow-up.  However, the day after Cohen' s call with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him 
to "[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat .. . It' s about Putin they called today."353  Sater 
then sent a  draft invitation for Cohen to  visit Moscow to discuss the Trump Moscow project, 354 
along with a note to "[t]ell me if the letter is good as amended by me or make whatever changes 
you want and send it back to me."355  After a  further round of edits, on January 25, 2016,  Sater 
sent  Cohen  an  invitation-
signed  by  Andrey  Ryabinskiy  of the  company  MHJ-to travel  to 
"Moscow for a working visit" about the "prospects of development and the construction business 
in  Russia," "the various land plots available suited for construction of this enormous Tower," and 
"the oppo1tunity to co-ordinate a follow up visit to Moscow by Mr. Donald Trump."356  According

d.  Discussions  about  Russia  Travel  by  Michael  Cohen  or  Candidate  Trump 

(December 2015-June 2016) 

i.  Sater 's Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia 

The  late  January  communication  was  neither  the  first  nor  the  last  time  that  Cohen 
contemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project.  Beginning in  late  2015, 
Sater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump 
Organization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing 
partners.  In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to 
Russia for meetings.358  On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: 

Please call me I have Evgeney  [Dvoskin] on the other line. [359]  He needs a copy of your 
and Donald's passports they  need  a  scan of every  page  of the passports.  Invitations & 
Visas  will  be  issued  this  week  by  VTB  Bank to  discuss  financing  for  Trump  Tower 
Moscow.  Politically  neither Putins  office  nor Ministry  of Foreign Affairs  cannot  issue 
invite, so they are inviting commercially/ business.  VTB is  Russia's 2  biggest bank and 
VTB Bank CEO Andrey Kostin, will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business 
meeting not political.  We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive  invite 
& have visa issued.360 

In response, Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport.361  Cohen told the Office that at one 
point he requested a copy of candidate Trump's passport from  Rhona Graff,  Trump's executive 
assistant at the  Trump  Organization, and  that Graff later  brought Trump' s passport to Cohen's

359  Toll  records  show that Sater was  speaking to  Evgeny  Dvoskin.  Call Records of Felix Sater 
Dvoskin is an executive of Genbank, a large bank with lending focused 
in Crimea, Ukraine.  At the time that Sater provided this financing letter to Cohen, Genbank was subject to 
U.S.  government sanctions, see Russia/Ukraine-related Sanctions and Identifications,  Office of Foreign 
Assets Control  (Dec.  22,  2015), available  at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC(cid:173)
Enforcement/Pages/20151222.aspx.  Dvoskin, who had been deported from the United States in 2000 for 
criminal activity, was under indictment in the United States for stock fraud under the aliases Eugene Slusker 
and Gene Shustar.  See United States v.  Rizzo,  et al., 2:03-cr-63 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 2003).

office.362  The investigation did not, however, establish that the passport was forwarded to Sater.363 

Into  the  spring  of 2016,  Sater  and  Cohen  continued  to  discuss  a  trip  to  Moscow  in 
connection with the Trump Moscow project.  On April 20, 2016, Sater wrote Cohen, "[t]he People 
. wanted to know when you are coming?"364  On May 4, 2016, Sater followed  up: 

I had a chat with Moscow.  ASSUMING the trip does happen the question is before or after 
the  convention.  I  said I  believe,  but don't know  for  sure,  that' s  it's probably  after the 
convention.  Obviously the pre-meeting trip (you only) can happen anytime you want but 
the 2  big guys where  [sic]  the  question.  I said  I would confirm and  revert. . . .  Let me 
know about If I was right by saying I believe after Cleveland and also when you want to 
speak to them and possibly fly over.365 

Cohen  responded, "My trip  before  Cleveland.  Trump once he  becomes  the  nominee  after  the 
convention."366 

The  day  after  this  exchange,  Sater  tied  Cohen' s  travel  to  Russia  to  the  St.  Petersburg 
International  Economic  Forum  ("Forum"),  an  annual  event  attended  by  prominent  Russian 
politicians and businessmen.  Sater told the Office that he was informed by a business associate 
that Peskov wanted to invite Cohen to the Forum.367  On May 5, 2016, Sater wrote to Cohen: 

Peskov would like to invite you as his guest to the St. Petersburg Forum which is Russia's 
Davos  it's  June  16-19.  He  wants to meet there with you and possibly  introduce  you to 
either Putin or Medvedev, as they are not sure if 1 or both will be there. 
This is perfect. The entire business class of Russia wiU  be there as well. 
He  said  anything  you  want to  discuss  including dates  and  subjects  are  on  the  table  to 
discuss[. ]368 

The following day, Sater asked Cohen to confirm those dates would work for him to travel; Cohen 
wrote back, "[w]orks for me."369

On June 9, 2016, Sater sent Cohen a notice that he (Sater) was completing the badges for 
the Forum, adding, "Putin is there on the  17th very strong chance you will meet him as well."370 
On June 13, 2016, Sater forwarded Cohen an invitation to the Forum signed by the Director of the 
Roscongress  Foundation, the  Russian  entity organizing  the  Forum. 371  Sater also  sent Cohen a 
Russian visa application and asked him to  send two passport photos.372  According to Cohen, the 
invitation gave no indication that Peskov had been involved in inviting him.  Cohen was concerned 
that Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as 
Sater had alleged), and  so he decided not to  go to the Forum.373  On June  14, 2016, Cohen met 
Sater in  the  lobby  of the Trump Tower in New York and  informed him that he  would not be 
traveling at that time. 374 

ii.  Candidate Trump's Opportunities to Travel to Russia 

The investigation  identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscow project 
was under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts. 

First, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling 
to Russia with Trump twice:  once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016. 375  According to Cohen, 
Trump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly.  On one occasion, 
Trump told Cohen to  speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to  coordinate the 
candidate's schedule.  Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they 
speak again when Cohen had actual dates to  evaluate.  Cohen indicated, however, that he knew 
that travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate's 
preexisting commitments to the Campaign.376 

Second, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an  invitation to the St. Petersburg 
International Economic Forum.  In late December 2015, Mira Duma-a contact oflvanka Trump' s 
from the fashion industry-first passed along  invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump 
from  Sergei Prikhodko, a  Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.377  On January  14, 
2016,  Rhona  Graff sent  an  email  to  Duma  stating  that  Trump  was  "honored  to  be  asked  to 
participate  in  the  highly  prestigious"  Forum  event,  but that  he  would  "have  to  decline"  the 
invitation given his "very grueling and full travel schedule" as a presidential candidate.378  Graff

U.S. Department of Justice 

asked  Duma whether  she  recommended  that  Graff "send  a  formal  note  to  the  Deputy Prime 
Minister" declining his invitation; Duma replied that a formal note would be "great."379 

It does not appear that Graff prepared that note immediately.  According to written answers 
from  President Trump,380  Graff received  an  email from  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Prikhodko  on 
March 17, 2016, again inviting Trump to participate in the 2016 Forum in St. Petersburg.381  Two 
weeks  later,  on March  31,  2016,  Graff prepared for  Trump's  signature  a  two-paragraph  letter 
declining  the  invitation.382  The  letter  stated  that  Trump's  "schedule  has  become  extremely 
demanding" because of the presidential campaign, that he "already ha[ d]  several commitments in 
the United States" for the time of the Forum, but that he otherwise "would have gladly given every 
consideration to  attending  such  an  important event."383  Graff forwarded  the  letter  to  another 
executive assistant at the Trump Organization with instructions to print the document on letterhead 
for Trump to sign.384 

At approximately the same time that the  letter was being prepared, Robert Foresman-a 
New York-based investment banker- began reaching out to Graff to secure an in-person meeting 
with candidate Trump.  According to Foresman, he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian 
presidential  aide  involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the 
Forum.385  Foresman  first  emailed  Graff on  March  31,  2016,  following  a  phone  introduction 
brokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The 
Apprentice). 
In  his  email,  Foresman  referenced  his  long-standing  personal  and  professional 
expertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early "private channel"  between Vladimir 
Putin and former U.S. President George W.  Bush, and an "approach" he had received from "senior 
Kremlin officials" about the candidate.  Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, 
Corey  Lewandowski,  or  "another relevant  person"  to  discuss  this  and  other  "concrete  things" 
Foresman  felt  uncomfortable  discussing  over  "unsecure  email." 386  On  April  4,  2016,  Graff 
forwarded  Foresman' s  meeting  request  to  Jessica  Macchia,  another  executive  assistant 
to Trump.387

380 As explained in  Volume II and Appendix C,  on September 17,  2018,  the Office sent written

those questions through counsel.

With no response forthcoming, Foresman twice sent reminders to Graff-first on April 26 
and again on April 30, 2016.388  Graff sent an apology to Foresman and forwarded his April 26 
email  ( as  well  as  his  initial  March  2016  email)  to  Lewandowski. 389  On May  2,  2016,  Graff 
forwarded  Foresman' s  April  30  email-which  suggested  an  alternative  meeting  with  Donald 
Trump Jr.  or Eric Trump  so  that Foresman could  convey to  them  information that "should  be 
conveyed to  [the  candidate]  personally  or  [to]  someone  [the  candidate]  absolutely  trusts"-to 
policy advisor Stephen Miller.390 

No  communications  or  other  evidence  obtained  by  the  Office  indicate  that the  Trump 
Campaign learned that Foresman was reaching out to invite the candidate to the Forum or that the 
Campaign otherwise followed up with Foresman until after the election, when he interacted with 
the Transition Team as he pursued a possible position in the incoming Administration.39 1  When 
interviewed  by the Office, Foresman denied that the  specific "approach"  from  "senior  Kremlin 
officials" noted in his March 31, 2016 email  was anything other than Kobyakov's invitation to 
Roscongress.  According to Foresman, the "concrete things" he referenced in the same email were 
a  combination  of the  invitation  itself,  Foresman's  personal  perspectives  on  the  invitation  and 
Russia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest 
Institute).  Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him 
to another Republican presidential  candidate and  one other politician.  Foresman also  said that 
Kobyakov had  asked Foresman to invite  Trump to speak after that other presidential  candidate 
withdrew  from  the  race  and  the  other politician's  participation  did  not  work  out.392  Finally, 
Foresman  claimed  to  have  no  plans  to  establish  a  back  channel  involving  Trump,  stating  the 
reference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials 
to the Campaign.  Foresman commented that he had not recognized any of the experts announced 
as Trump's foreign policy team  in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with 
the candidate to share his professional background and policy views, including that Trump should 
decline Kobyakov's invitation to speak at the Forum.393

2016  to  early  October 2016.394 
In  late  April  2016,  Papadopoulos was  told  by  London-based 
professor  Joseph  Mifsud,  immediately  after  Mifsud' s  return  from  a  trip  to  Moscow,  that  the 
Russian government had obtained "dirt" on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. 
One  week  later,  on  May  6,  2016,  Papadopoulos  suggested  to  a  representative  of  a  foreign 
government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that 
it  could  assist  the  Campaign  through  the  anonymous  release  of information  that  would  be 
damaging to candidate Clinton. 

Papadopoulos  shared  information  about  Russian  "dirt"  with  people  outside  of  the 
Campaign,  and  the  Office  investigated  whether  he  also  provided  it  to  a  Campaign  official. 
Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did 
· not recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information.  Throughout the relevant period of time 
and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals 
to arrange  a  meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government.  That meeting  never 
came to pass. 

a.  Origins of Campaign  Work 

In March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.395 
As early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in 
a September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors.396  In 
late  2015,  Papadopoulos  obtained  a  paid  position  on  the  campaign of Republican presidential 
candidate Ben Carson. 397 

Although Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 20 I 6, Papadopoulos 
had  stopped  actively  working  for  his  campaign  by  early  February  2016.398  At  that  time, 
Papadopoulos  reached  out  to  a  contact  at  the  London  Centre  of International  Law  Practice 
(LCILP),  which  billed  itself  as  a  "unique  institution  .  .  .  comprising  high-level  professional 
international law practitioners, dedicated to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the 
practice of international law."399  Papadopoulos said that he had finished his role with the Carson 

394  Papadopoulos met with our Office for debriefings on several occasions in the summer and fall 
of 2017, after he was arrested and charged in a sealed criminal complaint with making false  statements in 
a  January  2017  FBI  interview  about,  inter  alia,  the  timing,  extent,  and  nature  of his  interactions  and 
communications  with Joseph  Mifsud and two Russian  nationals:  Olga Polonskaya and Ivan Timofeev. 
Papadopoulos  later  pleaded  guilty,  pursuant to  a  plea agreement, to  an  information  charging him  with 
making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  lO0l(a).

campaign  and  asked  if LCILP  was  hiring.400  In early  February,  Papadopoulos  agreed  to join 
LCILP and arrived in London to  begin work.401 

As he was taking his position at LCILP, Papadopoulos contacted Trump campaign manager 
Corey  Lewandowski  via Linkedln  and  emailed  campaign  official  Michael  Glassner  about  his 
interest  in  joining  the  Trump  Campaign.402  On March  2,  2016,  Papadopoulos  sent  Glassner 
another message reiterating his interest.403  Glassner passed along word of Papadopoulos's interest 
to another campaign official, Joy Lutes, who  notified  Papadopoulos by email that she had been 
told by Glassner to introduce Papadopoulos to  Sam Clovis, the Trump Campaign's national co(cid:173)
chair and chief policy advisor .404 

At  the  time  of Papadopoulos's  March  2  email,  the  media  was  criticizing  the  Trump 
Campaign for lack of experienced foreign policy or national security advisors within its ranks.405 
To address that issue, senior Campaign officials asked Clovis to put a foreign policy team together 
on short notice.406  After receiving Papadopoulos's name from Lutes, Clovis performed a Google 
search on Papadopoulos, learned that he had worked at the Hudson Institute, and believed that he 
had  credibility  on  energy  issues.407  On  March  3,  2016,  Clovis  arranged  to  speak  with 
Papadopoulos by phone to discuss Papadopoulos joining the Campaign as a foreign policy advisor, 
and on March 6, 2016, the two spoke.408  Papadopoulos recalled that Russia was mentioned as a 
topic, and he  understood from the  conversation that Russia would be an important aspect of the 
Campaign's foreign policy.409  At the end of the conversation, Clovis offered Papadopoulos a role 
as a foreign policy advisor to the Campaign, and Papadopoulos accepted the offer.410

affiliated  with  Link  Campus  University,  a  for-profit  institution  headed  by  a  former  Italian 
government official.412  During the visit, Papadopoulos was introduced to Joseph Mifsud. 

Mifsud  is  a  Maltese  national  who  worked  as  a  professor  at  the  London  Academy  of 
Diplomacy in London, England.4 13  Although Mifsud worked out of London and was also affiliated 
with LCILP, the  encounter in  Rome  was the first time that Papadopoulos met him.414  Mifsud 
maintained various Russian contacts while living in London, as described further below.  Among 
,415  a one-time employee of the IRA, the entity that carried out 
his contacts was

According to  Papadopoulos,  Mifsud at first  seemed  uninterested  in Papadopoulos when 
they met in Rome.416  After Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump Campaign, 
however, Mifsud appeared to take greater interest in Papadopoulos.417  The two discussed Mifsud ' s 
European and Russian contacts and had a general discussion about Russia; Mifsud also offered to 
introduce  Papadopoulos  to  European  leaders  and  others  with  contacts  to  the  Russian 
government.418  Papadopoulos told the Office that Mifsud' s claim of substantial connections with 
Russian government officials interested Papadopoulos, who thought that such connections could 
increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.419

On  March  17,  2016,  Papadopoulos  returned  to  London.42° Four  days  later,  candidate 
Trump publicly named him as a member of the foreign policy and national security advisory team 
chaired by Senator Jeff Sessions, describing Papadopoulos as "an oil and energy consultant" and 
an "[e]xcellent guy."421 

On  March  24,  2016,  Papadopoulos  met  with  Mifsud  in  London.422  Mifsud  was 
accompanied by a Russian female  named Olga Polonskaya.  Mifsud introduced Polonskaya as a 
former student of his who had connections to Vladimir Putin.423  Papadopoulos understood at the 
time that Polonskaya may have been Putin' s niece but later learned that this was not true.424  During 
the meeting, Polonskaya offered to help Papadopoulos establish contacts in Russia and stated that 
the Russian ambassador in London was a friend of hers.425  Based on this interaction, Papadopoulos 
expected Mifsud and Polonskaya to introduce him to the Russian ambassador in London, but that 
did not occur.426 

Following his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos sent an email to members of the Trump 
Campaign' s foreign policy advisory team.  The subject line  of the message  was "Meeting with 
Russian leadership--including Putin."427  The message stated in pertinent part: 

I just finished  a  very  productive  lunch  with  a  good friend  of mine,  Joseph  Mifsud, the 
director of the London Academy of Diplomacy--who introduced me to both Putin's niece 
and the Russian Ambassador in London--who also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister.428 

The topic of the lunch was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to 
discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump. They are keen to  host us in  a "neutral" 
city, or directly in Moscow. They said the leadership, including Putin, is ready to meet with 
us  and Mr.  Trump should there  be interest.  Waiting for everyone's thoughts  on moving 
forward with this very important issue.429

Papadopoulos's message came at a time when Clovis perceived a shift in the Campaign' s approach 
toward  Russia-from one  of engaging with  Russia throu  h  the NA TO framework and takin  a 
stron  stance  on Russian  a 

ression  in  Ukraine, 

Clovis' s  response  to  Papadopoulos,  however,  did  not  reflect  that  shift.  Replying  to 
Papadopoulos  and the other members  of the foreign policy advisory  team copied on the  initial 
email, Clovis wrote: 

This is most informative. Let me work it through the campaign. No commitments until we 
see how this  plays out. My thought is  that we probably should not go forward  with any 
meetings  with  the  Russians  until  we  have  had  occasion  to  sit with  our  NATO  allies, 
especially France, Germany and Great Britain. We need to reassure our allies that we are 
not going to advance anything with Russia until we have everyone on the same page. 

More thoughts later today. Great work.431 

c.  March 31 Foreign Policy Team Meeting 

The Campaign held a  meeting of the foreign policy advisory team with Senator Sessions 
and candidate Trump approximately one week later, on March 31, 2016, in Washington,  D.C.432 
The meeting-which was intended to generate press coverage for the Campaign433-took place at 
the Trump International Hotel.434  Papadopoulos flew to Washington for the event.  At the meeting, 
Senator Sessions sat at one end of an oval table, while Trump sat at the other.  As reflected in the 
photograph below (which was posted to Trump's Instagram account), Papadopoulos sat between 
the two, two seats to Sessions's left:

March 31, 2016 Meeting of Foreign Policy Team, with Papadopoulos (Fourth from Right of Candidate Trump) 

During  the  meeting,  each  of the  newly  announced  foreign  policy  advisors  introduced 
themselves and briefly described their areas  of experience or expertise.435  Papadopoulos  spoke 
about his previous work in the energy sector and then brought up a potential meeting with Russian 
officials.436  Specifically, Papadopoulos told the group that he had learned through his contacts in 
London that Putin wanted  to  meet with candidate Trump and that these connections could help 
arrange that meeting.437 

Trump  and  Sessions  both  reacted  to  Papadopoulos's  statement.  Papadopoulos  and 
Campaign  advisor J.D.  Gordon- who  told  investigators  in  an  interview that he  had  a  "crystal 
clear" recollection of the meeting-have stated that Trump was interested in and receptive to the 
idea of a meeting with Putin.438  Papadopoulos understood Sessions to be similarly supportive of 
his efforts to arrange a meeting.439  Gordon and two other attendees, however, recall that Sessions 
generally opposed the proposal, though they differ in their accounts of the concerns he voiced or 
the strength of the opposition he expressed.440

making further efforts to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. 
To the contrary, Papadopoulos told the Office that he  understood the Campaign to be supportive 
of  his  efforts  to  arrange  such  a  meeting.441  Accordingly,  when  he  returned  to  London, 
Papadopoulos resumed those efforts.442 

Throughout April 2016, Papadopoulos continued to correspond with, meet with, and seek 
Russia contacts through Mifsud and, at times, Polonskaya.443  For example, within a week of her 
initial March 24 meeting with him, Polonskaya attempted to send Papadopoulos a text message(cid:173)
which  email  exchanges  show  to  have  been  drafted  or  edited  by  Mifsud-addressing 
Papadopoulos' s "wish to engage with the Russian Federation."444  When Papadopoulos learned 
from  Mifsud that Polonskaya had tried to  message  him,  he  sent her  an  email  seeking  another 
meeting.445  Polonskaya responded the next day that she was "back in St. Petersburg"  but "would 
be very pleased to support [Papadopoulos's]  initiatives between our two countries"  and "to  meet 
[him] again."446  Papadopoulos stated in reply that he thought "a good step" would be to introduce 
him to "the Russian Ambassador in London," and that he would like to talk to the ambassador, "or 
anyone else you recommend, about a potential foreign policy trip to Russia." 447 

Mifsud, who had been copied on the email exchanges, replied on the morning of April  11, 
2016.  He wrote, "This is already been agreed.  I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai 
meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma.  We will talk tomorrow."448  The two bodies referenced 
by Mifsud are part of or associated with the Russian government:  the Duma is a Russian legislative 
assembly,449 while "Valdai" refers to the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based group that "is 
close to Russia's foreign-policy establishment."450  Papadopoulos thanked Mifsud and said that he 
would see him "tomorrow."451  For her part, Polonskaya responded that she had "already alerted 
my  personal  links  to  our  conversation  and  your  request,"  that  "we  are  all  very  excited  the 
possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump," and that "[t]he Russian Federation would love 
to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced."452

Papadopoulos's  and  Mifsud's  mentions  of seeing  each  other  "tomorrow"  referenced  a 
meeting that the two  had  scheduled for the  next morning, April  12,  2016, at the Andaz Hotel in 
London.  Papadopoulos  acknowledged  the  meeting  during  interviews  with  the  Office,453  and 
records  from  Papadopoulos's  UK cellphone and  his  internet-search history all  indicate that the 
meeting took place.454 

Following the  meeting, Mifsud traveled  as  planned to Moscow.455  On April  18, 2016, 
while in Russia, Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos over email to Ivan Timofeev, a member of the 
Russian  International  Affairs  Council  (RIAC).456  Mifsud  had  described  Timofeev  as  having 
connections with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA),457 the executive entity in Russia 
responsible for  Russian  foreign  relations.458  Over  the  next  several  weeks,  Papadopoulos  and 
Timofeev had multiple conversations over Skype and email about setting "the groundwork" for a 
"potential" meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.459  Papadopoulos 
told the Office that, on one Skype call, he believed that his conversation with Timofeev was being 
monitored or supervised by an unknown third party, because Timofeev spoke in an official manner 
and Papadopoulos heard odd noises on the line.460  Timofeev also told Papadopoulos in an April 
25, 2016 email that he had just spoken "to Igor Ivanov[,] the President ofRIAC and former Foreign 
Minister of Russia," and conveyed Ivanov's advice about how best to arrange a "Moscow visit."461 

After a  stop in  Rome, Mifsud returned to  England on April 25, 2016.462  The next day, 
Papadopoulos  met  Mifsud  for  breakfast  at  the  Andaz  Hotel  (the  same  location  as  their  last

meeting).463  During  that meeting,  Mifsud  told  Papadopoulos  that he  had  met with  high-level 
Russian government officials during his recent trip to Moscow.  Mifsud also said that, on the trip, 
he learned that the Russians had obtained "dirt" on candidate Hillary Clinton.  As Papadopoulos 
later stated to the FBI, Mifsud said that the "dirt" was in the form of " emails of Clinton," and that 
they "have thousands  of emails."464  On May 6, 2016,  10 days after that meeting with  Mifsud, 
Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had 
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the  Campaign through the 
anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.465 

e.  Russia-Related Communications With  The Campaign 

While he was discussing with his foreign contacts a potential meeting of campaign officials 
with Russian government officials, Papadopoulos kept campaign officials apprised of his efforts. 
On April 25, 2016, the day before Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the emails, Papadopoulos wrote 
to senior policy advisor Stephen Miller that "[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by 
Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready," and that "[t]he advantage of being in London 
is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities."466  On April 27, 2016, 
after his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos wrote a second message to Miller stating that "some 
interesting messages [were] coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right."467  The 
same day,  Papadopoulos sent a similar email to  campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, telling 
Lewandowski that Papadopoulos had "been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin 
wanting to host [Trump] and the team when the time is right. "468 

Papadopoulos' s  Russia-related  communications  with  Campaign  officials  continued 
throughout the spring and summer of 2016.  On May 4, 2016, he forwarded to Lewandowski an 
email  from  Timofeev  raising  the  possibility  of a  meeting  in  Moscow,  asking  Lewandowski 
whether that was " something we want to  move forward with."469  The next day,  Papadopoulos 
forwarded  the  same  Timofeev  email  to  Sam  Clovis,  adding  to  the  top  of the  email  "Russia 
update."470  He included the same email in a May 21, 2016 message to senior Campaign official 
Paul  Manafort,  under  the  subject  line  "Request from  Russia  to  meet Mr.  Trump,"  stating that 
"Russia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me

On June 1, 2016, Papadopoulos replied to an earlier email chain with Lewandowski about 
a Russia visit, asking if Lewandowski "want[ ed] to have a call about this topic" and whether "we 
were following  up with it."473  After Lewandowski told Papadopoulos to "connect with" Clovis 
because he was "running point," Papadopoulos emailed Clovis that "the Russian MF A" was asking 
him "if Mr. Trump is  interested in visiting Russia at some point."474  Papadopoulos wrote in an 
email that he "[w]anted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what's best to do with it 
and what message I should send (or to ignore)."475 

After several email and Skype exchanges with Timofeev,476  Papadopoulos sent one more 
email to  Lewandowski on June 19, 2016, Lewandowski's last day as campaign manager.477  The 
email stated that "[t]he Russian ministry of foreign affairs" had contacted him and asked whether, 
if Mr. Trump could not travel to Russia, a  campaign representative such as Papadopoulos could 
attend meetings.478  Papadopoulos told Lewandowski that he was "willing to make the trip off the 
record if it's in the interest of Mr. Trump and the campaign to meet specific people."479 

Following  Lewandowski's  departure  from  the  Campaign,  Papadopoulos  communicated 

with Clovis and Walid Phares, another member of the foreign policy advisory team, about an off(cid:173)

a distant relative of then-Trump Organization lawyer Jason Greenblatt-emailed Clovis about a potential

Putin."  DJTFP00011547 (5/15/16 Email, Klein to Clovis (5:45:24 p.m.)).  The investigation did not find

Klein's subsequent meeting with Greenblatt and Rabbi Lazar at Trump Tower.  Klein 8/30/18 302, at 2.

Group on Counterterrorism (TAG), a group for which Phares was co-secretary general.481  On July 
16,  2016,  Papadopoulos  attended  the TAG summit in  Washington,  D.C.,  where he  sat next to 
Clovis (as reflected in the photograph below).482 

George Papadopoulos (far right) and Sam Clovis (second from right) 

Although  Clovis  claimed  to  have  no  recollection  of  attending  the  TAG  summit,483 
Papadopoulos  remembered discussing  Russia and  a  foreign  policy trip with Clovis  and Phares 
during the event.484  Papadopoulos's recollection is  consistent with  emails  sent before and  after 
the  TAG summit.  The  pre-summit messages  included  a  July  11,  2016  email  in which Phares 
suggested meeting Papadopoulos the day after the summit to chat,485  and a July 12 message in the 
same chain in which Phares advised Papadopoulos that other summit attendees "are very nervous 
about Russia.  So be aware."486  Ten days after the summit, Papadopoulos sent an email to Mifsud 
listing Phares and Clovis as other "participants" in a potential meeting at the London Academy of 
Diplomacy.487 

Finally,  Papadopoulos's  recollection  is  also  consistent  with  handwritten  notes  from  a

Later communications indicate that Clovis  determined  that he (Clovis)  could not travel. 
On August 15, 2016, Papadopoulos emailed Clovis that he had received requests from  multiple 
foreign  governments,  "even Russia[],"  for  "closed  door workshops/consultations  abroad,"  and 
asked whether there was still interest for Clovis, Phares, and Papadopoulos "to go on that trip."490 
Clovis copied Phares on his response, which said that he could not "travel before the election" but 
that he "would encourage [Papadopoulos] and Walid to make the trips, if it is feasible."491

Papadopoulos was  dismissed from the Trump Campaign in early October 2016, after an 

interview he gave to the Russian news agency Inter/ax generated adverse publicity.492 

f.  Trump Campaign Knowledge of "Dirt" 

Papadopoulos  admitted  telling  at  least  one  individual  outside  of  the  Campaign(cid:173)
specifically, the then-Greek foreign minister-about Russia's obtaining Clinton-related emails.493 
In addition,  a  different foreign  government  informed the  FBI that,  10  days  after  meeting with 
Mifsud  in  late  April  2016,  Papadopoulos  suggested  that  the  Trump  Campaign  had  received 
indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous 
release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton.494  (This conversation occurred 
after the GRU spearphished Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta and stole his emails, and 
the  GRU hacked into the DCCC and DNC, see Volume l, Sections III.A & III.B, supra.)  Such 
disclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulos informed any Trump Campaign official 
about the emails. 

When interviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told 
the  Office  that they  could  not  recall  Papadopoulos' s  sharing  the  information that  Russia  had 
obtained "dirt" on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign 
through the anonymous release of information about Clinton.  Papadopoulos stated that he could 
not clearly recall having told anyone on the Campaign and wavered about whether he accurately 
remembered an  incident in which Clovis had been upset after hearing Papadopoulos tell Clovis 
that Papadopoulos thought "they have her emails."495  The Campaign officials who interacted or 
corresponded with Papadopoulos have similarly stated, with varying degrees of certainty, that he 
did not tell them.  Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, for example, did not remember hearing 
anything  from  Papadopoulos  or  Clovis  about  Russia  having  emails  of  or  dirt  on  candidate 
Clinton.496  Clovis stated that he did not recall anyone, including Papadopoulos, having given him 
non-public information that a forei  n  overnment mi  ht be in  ossession of material dama  in  to 
Hillar  Clinton.497

No documentary evidence, and nothing in the email accounts or other 
communications  facilities  reviewed  by  the  Office,  shows  that  Papadopoulos  shared  this 
information with the Campaign. 

g.  Additional George Papadopoulos Contact 

The Office investigated another Russia-related contact with Papadopoulos.  The Office was 
not fully  able to  explore the contact because the  individual at issue-Sergei Millian-remained 
out of the country since the inception of our investigation and declined to meet with members of 
the Office despite our repeated efforts to obtain an interview. 

Papadopoulos first connected with Millian  via  Linkedln on July  15,  2016,  shmtly  after 
Papadopoulos had attended the TAG Summit with Clovis.500  Millian, an American citizen who is 
a native of Belarus, introduced himself "as president of [the] New York-based Russian American 
Chamber of Commerce," and claimed that through that position he had " insider knowledge and 
direct access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics."501  Papadopoulos asked Timofeev whether 
he had heard of Millian.502  Although Timofeev said no,503  Papadopoulos met Millian in New York 
City.504  The meetings took place on July 30 and August 1, 2016.505  Afterwards, Millian invited 
Papadopoulos  to  attend-and  potentially  speak  at-two  international  energy  conferences, 
including one that was to be held in Moscow in September 2016.506  Papadopoulos ultimately did 
not attend either conference. 

On  July  31 ,  2016,  following  his  first  in-person  meeting  with  Millian,  Papadopoulos 
emailed Trump Campaign official Bo Denysyk to say that he had been contacted "by some leaders 
of Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump," and to 
ask whether he should "put you in touch with their group (US-Russia chamber of commerce)." 507 
Denysyk  thanked  Papadopoulos  "for  taking  the  initiative,"  but  asked  him  to  "hold  off with

then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and candidate Trump as " being pro-Russian."508 

On August 23, 2016, Millian sent a Facebook message to Papadopoulos promising that he 
would "share with you a disruptive technology that might be instrumental in your political work 
for the campaign."509  Papadopoulos claimed to have no recollection of this matter.510 

On November 9, 2016, shortly after the election, Papadopoulos  arranged to meet Millian 
in Chicago to discuss business opportunities, including potential work with Russian "billionaires 
who are not under sanctions."511  The meeting took place on November 14, 2016,  at the Trump 
Hotel and Tower in Chicago.512  According to Papadopoulos, the two men discussed partnering on 
business  deals,  but Papadopoulos  perceived  that  Millian's  attitude  toward  him  changed  when 
Papadopoulos stated that he was only pursuing private-sector opportunities and was not interested 
in a job in the Administration.5 13  The two remained in contact, however, and had extended online 
discussions about possible business opportunities in Russia. 514  The two also arranged to meet at a 
Washington, D.C. bar when both attended Trump's inauguration in late January 2017.515 

3.  Carter Page 

Carter Page worked for the Trump Campaign from January 2016 to September 2016.  He 
was  formally  and  publicly  announced  as  a  foreign  policy  advisor  by  the  candidate  in  March 
2016.516  Page had lived and worked in Russia, and he had been approached by Russian intelligence 
officers several years  before he volunteered for the Trump Campaign.  During his time with the 
Campaign,  Page  advocated  pro-Russia  foreign  policy positions  and traveled  to  Moscow  in  his 
personal capacity. Russian intelligence officials had formed  relationships with Page in 2008 and 
2013 and Russian officials may have focused on Page in 2016 because of his affiliation with the 
Campaign.  However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian 
government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

a.  Background 

Before he began working for the Campaign in January 2016,  Page had substantial  prior 
experience studying Russian policy issues and living and working in Moscow.  From 2004 to 2007, 
Page was the deputy branch manager of Merrill Lynch's Moscow office. 517  There, he worked on 
transactions  involving  the  Russian  energy  company  Gazprom  and  came  to  know  Gazprom's 
deputy chief financial officer, Sergey Yatsenko.518 

In 2008, Page founded Global Energy Capital LLC (GEC), an in~  

advisor  firm  focused  on the  ener 

sector in emerging markets.519 
- - - - -
520  The company otherwise had no  sources of income, and 
Page  was  forced  to  draw  down  his  life  savings  to  support  himself  and  pursue  his  business 
venture.521  Pa  e asked Yatsenko to work with him at GEC as a senior advisor on a contin 

In 2008, Page met Alexander Bulatov, a Russian government official who worked at the 
Russian Consulate  in New York. 523  Pa  e  later learned that Bulatov was  a  Russian intelli  ence 
officer, 

524 

In  2013, Victor Podobnyy,  another Russian  intelligence  officer working covertly  in the 
United States under diplomatic cover, formed a relationship with Page.525  Podobnyy met Page at 
an  energy  symposium in New York City and  began exchanging emails with him.526  Podobnyy 
and Page also met in person on multiple occasions, during which Page offered his outlook on the 
future of the energy industry and provided documents to  Podobnyy about the energy business. 527 
In a recorded conversation on April 8, 2013, Podobnyy told another intelligence officer that Page 
was interested in business opportunities in Russia.528  In Podobnyy's words, Page "got hooked on

Gazprom thinking that if they have a project, he could ... rise up.  Maybe he can .... [I]t' s obvious 
that he wants to earn lots of money."529  Podobnyy said that he had led Page on by "feed[ing] him 
empty  promises"  that Podobnyy  would  use  his  Russian  business  connections  to  help  Page.530 
Podobnyy told the other intelligence officer that his method of recruiting foreign sources was to 
promise them favors and then discard them once he obtained relevant information from them. 53 1 

In  2015,  Podobnyy  and  two  other  Russian  intelligence  officers  were  charged  with 
conspiracy to act as  an unregistered agent of a  foreign government. 532  The criminal complaint 
detailed  Podobnyy's interactions with and conversations about Page, who was identified only as 
"Male-1."533  Based on the criminal complaint's description of the  interactions, Page was aware 
that he was the individual described as "Male-l." 534  Page later spoke with a Russian government 
official at the United Nations General Assembly and identified himself so that the official would 
laint. 535  Pa  e told the official that he "didn't 
understand he was "Male-I" from the Podobn 
do anything" 

536 

In  interviews  with  the  FBI  before  the  Office's  opening,  Page  acknowledged  that  he 
understood that the individuals he had associated with were members of the Russian intelligence 
services, but he stated that he had only provided immaterial non-public information to them and 
that he did not view this relationship as a backchannel.537  Page told investigating agents that "the 
more immaterial non-public information I give them, the better for this country." 538 

b.  Origins of and Early Campaign  Work 

In  January  2016,  Page  began  volunteering  on  an  informal,  unpaid  basis for the Trump 
Campaign after Ed Cox, a  state Republican Party official,  introduced Page to Trump Campaign 
officials.539  Page told the Office that his goal in working on the Campaign was to help candidate 
Trump improve relations with Russia.540  To that end, Page emailed Campaign officials offering 
his thoughts on U.S.-Russia relations, prepared talking points and briefing memos on Russia, and

proposed that candidate Trump meet with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. 541 

In communications with Campaign officials,  Page  also  repeatedly touted  his  high-level 
contacts  in  Russia  and  his  ability  to  forge  connections  between  candidate  Trump  and  senior 
Russian governmental officials.  For example, on January 30, 2016, Page sent an email to senior 
Campaign officials stating that he had "spent the past week in Europe and ha[ d] been in discussions 
with some individuals with close ties to the Kremlin" who  recognized that Trump could have a 
"game-changing effect ... in bringing the  end of the new Cold War."542  The email  stated that 
" [t]hrough [his]  discussions with these high level  contacts," Page believed that "a direct meeting 
in Moscow between Mr[.]  Trump and  Putin could  be arran  ed."543  Pa  e  closed  the  email  b 
criticizin  U.S.  sanctions  on Russia.544 

On March 21 , 2016, candidate Trump formally  and publicly identified Page as a member 
of his  foreign  policy team to  advise on Russia and  the energy sector.546  Over the next several 
months,  Page  continued  providing  policy-related  work  product  to  Campaign  officials.  For 
example, in April 2016, Page provided feedback on an outline for a foreign policy speech that the 
candidate gave at the Mayflower Hotel,547 see Volume I, Section IV.A.4, infra.  In May 2016, Page 
prepared an outline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck, 
North Dakota,  to watch the  candidate  deliver the  speech.548  Chief policy  advisor  Sam  Clovis 
expressed appreciation for Page's work and praised his work to other Campaign officials.549 

c.  Carter Page's July 2016 Trip To Moscow 

Page's affiliation with the Trump Campaign took on a higher profile and drew the attention 
of Russian officials  after the  candidate named him a  foreign policy advisor.  As a result,  in  late 
April 2016, Page was invited to give a speech at the July 2016 commencement ceremony at the

New  Economic  School  (NES)  in  Moscow. 550  The  NES  commencement  ceremony  generally 
featured high-profile speakers; for example, President Barack Obama delivered a commencement 
address at the school in 2009. 551  NES officials told the Office that the interest in inviting Page to 
speak at NES was' based entirely on his status as  a Trump Campaign advisor who served as  the 
candidate's Russia expert.552  Andrej  Krickovic, an associate of Page's and assistant professor at 
the Higher School of Economics in Russia, recommended that NES  rector Shlomo Weber invite 
Page to  give  the  commencement  address  based  on his  connection  to  the  Trump  Campaign.553 
Denis Klimentov, an employee ofNES, said that when Russians learned of Page's involvement in 
the  Trump  Campaign  in  March  2016,  the  excitement was  palpable.554  Weber recalled  that in 
summer 2016 there was substantial interest in the Trump Campaign in Moscow, and he felt that 
bringing a member of the Campaign to the school would be beneficial. 555 

Page was  eager to  accept the  invitation to  speak at NES,  and  he  sought approval  from 
Trump Campaign officials to make the trip to Russia. 556  On May 16, 2016, while that request was 
still under consideration, Page emailed Clovis, J.D. Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that 
candidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow.557  On June 
19, 2016, Page followed  up  again to request approval to  speak at the NES event and to reiterate 
that NES  "would  love  to  have  Mr.  Trump speak at this  annual  celebration" in  Page's place.558 
Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, "If you want to do this, 
it  would be out side  [sic]  of your role with  the  DJT for President campaign.  I  am  certain Mr. 
Trump will not be able to attend."559 

In early July 2016, Page traveled to Russia for the NES events.  On July 5, 2016,  Denis 
Klimentov, copying his brother, Dmitri Klimentov,560 emailed Maria Zakharova, the Director of 
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information and Press Department, about Page's visit and 
his  connection to the Trump Campaign.56 1  Denis  Klimentov said  in the email that he wanted to 
draw the Russian government's attention to Page's visit in Moscow.562  His message to Zakharova

continued:  "Page is Trump's adviser on foreign policy.  He is a known businessman; he  used to 
work in Russia ... .  If you have any questions, I will be happy to help contact him."563  Dmitri 
Klimentov then  contacted  Russian  Press  Secretary  Dmitry Peskov  about Page's visit to  see  if 
Peskov wanted to  introduce Page  to  any  Russian  government officials.564  The  following  day, 
Peskov  responded  to  what  appears  to  have  been  the  same  Denis  Klimentov-Zakharova  email 
thread.  Peskov wrote, "I have read about [Page].  Specialists say that he is far from being the main 
one.  So I better not initiate a meeting in the Kremlin."565 

On July 7, 2016, Page delivered the first of his two speeches in Moscow at NES. 566  In the 
speech,  Page  criticized  the  U.S.  government's  foreign  policy  toward  Russia,  stating  that 
"Washington  and  other  Western  capitals  have  impeded  potential  progress  through  their  often 
hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change."567 
On July 8, 2016, Page delivered a speech during the NES commencement.568  After Page delivered 
his  commencement  address,  Russian  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  NES  board  member Arkady 
Dvorkovich spoke at the ceremony and stated that the sanctions the United States had imposed on 
Russia had hurt the NES. 569  Page and Dvorkovich shook hands at the commencement ceremony, 
and  Weber recalled  that  Dvorkovich  made  statements  to  Pa  e  about workin 
to  ether  in the 
future. 570 

Page said that,  during his time  in Moscow,  he  met with friends  and associates  he  knew 
from when he lived  in Russia,  including Andrey Baranov, a former Gazprom employee who had 
become the head of investor relations at Rosneft, a Russian energy company. 572  Page stated that 
he  and  Baranov  talked  about  "immaterial  non-public"  information.573  Page  believed  he  and

the  possibility  of a  sale  of a  stake  in  Rosneft  in  passing.574  Page  recalled  mentioning  his 
involvement in the Trump Campaign with Baranov, although he did not remember details of the 
conversation.575  Page  also  met with  individuals  from  Tatneft,  a  Russian  energy  company,  to 
discuss possible business deals, including having Page work as a consultant.576 

On July 8,  2016, while he was in Moscow, Page emailed several Campaign officials and 
stated he would send "a readout soon regarding some incredible insights and outreach I've received 
from  a few Russian  legislators and senior members  of the  Presidential Administration here. " 577 
On July 9, 2016, Page emailed Clovis, writing in pertinent part: 

Russian  Deputy Prime minister and NES  board member Arkady Dvorkovich also  spoke 
before the event.  In a private conversation, Dvorkovich expressed strong support for Mr. 
Trump and  a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the 
vast range of current international problems.  Based on feedback from  a  diverse array of 
other  sources  close to  the  Presidential  Administration,  it was readily  apparent that this 
sentiment is widely held at all levels of government.578 

The  Office  was  unable to  obtain  additional  evidence  or testimony about who  Page 
may have met or communicated with in Moscow; thus, Page's activities in Russia-as described 
in his emails with the Campaign-were not fully explained.

d.  Later Campaign Work and Removal from the Campaign 

In  July  2016,  after  returning  from  Russia,  Page  traveled  to  the  Republican  National 
Convention  in Cleveland.583  While  there,  Page  met Russian  Ambassador to the  United  States 
Sergey Kislyak; that interaction is  described  in Volume I, Section IV.A.6.a, infra.584  Page later 
emailed Campaign officials with feedback he said he received from ambassadors he had met at the 
Convention, and he wrote that Ambassador Kisl  ak was ver  worried about candidate Clinton's 
world  views. 585 

Following the Convention, Page's trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russia foreign 
policy drew the media's attention and began to generate substantial press coverage.  The Campaign 
responded by distancing itself from Page, describing him as an "informal foreign policy advisor" 
who did "not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign."587  On September 23, 2016, Yahoo!  News 
reported  that  U.S.  intelligence  officials  were  investigating  whether  Page  had  opened  private 
communications with senior Russian officials to  discuss U.S.  sanctions policy  under  a  possible 
Trump Administration. 588  A Campaign spokesman told Yahoo!  News that Page had "no role" in 
the Campaign and that the Campaign was "not aware of any of his activities, past or present."589 
On September 24, 2016, Page was formally removed from the Campaign.590 

Although  Page  had  been  removed  from  the  Campaign,  after the  election  he  sought  a 
position in the Trump Administration.59 1  On November 14, 2016, he submitted an application to 
the Transition Team that inflated his credentials and experiences, stating that in his capacity as a 
Trump  Campaign foreign  policy  advisor he had  met  with  "top  world  leaders"  and "effectively

When Page took a  personal  trip to  Moscow in December 2016,  he met again with  at least one 
Russian government official.  That interaction and a discussion of the December trip are set forth 
in Volume I,  Section IV.B.6, infra. 

4.  Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest 

Members of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the 
National  Interest  (CNI),  principally through  its  President and  Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri 
Simes.  CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government.  Simes 
was born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the  1970s.  In April 
2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event 
hosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI.  Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and 
Russian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in 
relation to Sessions's confirmation hearings to become Attorney General.  Sessions had various 
other contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. 
Jared  Kushner  also  interacted  with  Simes  about  Russian  issues  during  the  campaign.  The 
investigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or 
from the Russian government through CNI or Simes. 

a.  CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign 

CNI is a  Washington-based non-profit organization that grew out of a center founded by 
former President Richard Nixon.593  CNI describes  itself "as a  voice for strategic realism in U.S. 
foreign policy," and publishes a bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, the National Interest.594  CNI 
is  overseen by a  board of directors  and an advisory  council  that is  largely honorary  and whose 
members at the relevant time included Sessions, who served as an advisor to candidate Trump on 
national security and foreign policy issues.595 

Dimitri Simes is  president and CEO  of CNI and the  publisher and CEO  of the National 
Jnterest. 596  Simes was born in the former Soviet Union, emigrated to the United States in the early 
1970s, and joined CNI' s predecessor after working at the Carnegie Endowment for International

Peace.597  Simes  personally  has  many  contacts  with  current  and  former  Russian  government 
officials,598  as  does  CNI  collectively.  As  CNI  stated when  seeking  a  grant from  the Carnegie 
Corporation  in  2015,  CNI  has  "unparalleled  access  to  Russian officials  and  politicians among 
Washington think tanks," 599  in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia 
and for Russian delegations  to visit the  United States as  patt of so-called "Track 11"  diplomatic 
· efforts.600 

On March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and 
its honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.601  The idea 
behind the event was to generate interest in CNI's work and recruit new board members for CNI.602 
Along  with  Simes,  attendees  at  the  event  included  Jared  Kushner,  son-in-law  of candidate 
Trump.603  Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was 
having trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result, 
he decided to seek Simes's assistance during the March 14 event.604 

Simes and Kushner spoke again  on a  March 24, 2016  telephone call,605  three days after 
Trump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short 
notice.606  On March  31,  2016,  Simes  and  Kushner  had  an  in-person,  one-on-one  meeting  in 
Kushner's  New York office.607  During that meeting,  Simes told Kushner  that the  best way to 
handle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of 
experts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent 
with Trump's voice.608  Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion.609 

Simes  also  had  contact  with  other  individuals  associated  with  the  Trump  Campaign 
regarding the Campaign's foreign policy positions.  For example,  on June  17, 2016, Simes sent 
J.D. Gordon an email with a "memo to  Senator Sessions that we discussed at our recent meeting"

and asked Gordon to both read it and share it with Sessions.  The memorandum proposed building 
a "small and carefully selected group of experts" to assist Sessions with the Campaign, operating 
under the assumption "that Hillary Clinton  is  very vulnerable  on  national  security  and  foreign 
policy  issues."  The  memorandum  outlined  key  issues  for  the  Campaign,  including  a  "new 
beginning with Russia."610 

b.  National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel 

During both their March 24 phone call and their March 31  in-person meeting,  Simes and 
Kushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.611 
Following  those  conversations,  Simes  agreed  that  he  and  others  associated  with  CNI  would 
provide  behind-the-scenes  input  on  the  substance  of the  foreign-policy  speech  and  that  CNI 
officials  would  coordinate  the  logistics  of the  speech  with  Sessions  and  his  staff,  including 
Sessions's chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.612 

In mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller 
and forwarded to Simes an outline of the foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.613  Simes 
sent back to  the  Campaign bullet points with ideas  for the speech that he had drafted with CNI 
Executive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt.6 14  Simes received subsequent 
draft  outlines  from  Miller,  and  he  and  Saunders  spoke  to  Miller  by  phone  about  substantive 
changes to the speech.615  It is not clear, however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft 
of the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not, 
and the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft.616 

After board members expressed concern to Simes that CNl's hosting the speech could be 
perceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to  have  its  publication, the 
National Interest, serve as the host and to  have the event at the National Press Club.617  Kushner 
later  requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was  another  venue  that 
Simes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to  address  concerns 
about security and capacity.618

U.S. Department of Justice 

On April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event rooms at the Mayflower to host both the speech 

and a VIP reception that was to be held beforehand.619  Saunders understood that the reception(cid:173)
at which  invitees would have the chance to  meet· candidate Trump--would be a  small event.620 
Saunders decided who would attend by looking at the list of CNI' s invitees to the speech itself and 
then choosing a subset for the reception.621  CNI's invitees to the reception included Sessions and 
Kislyak.622  The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to 
the speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump.623 

When the pre-speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized 
so that attendees could meet Trump.624  Sessions first stood next to Trump to introduce him to the 
members  of Congress  who  were  in  attendance.625  After those members  had  been  introduced, 
Simes  stood  next  to  Trump  and  introduced  him  to  the  CNI  invitees  in  attendance,  including 
Kislyak.626  Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thought it clear that 
Kislyak and Trump had just met for the first time.627  Kislyak also met Kushner during the pre(cid:173)
speech reception.  The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner 
recalled Kislyak saying, "we like what your candidate is saying ... it's refreshing."628 

Several  public  reports  state  that,  in  addition  to  speaking to  Kushner  at the pre-speech 
reception,  Kislyak  also  met  or  conversed  with  Sessions  at  that  time.629  Sessions  stated  to 
investigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation.630  Nor did anyone else 
affiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between 
Sessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.631  It appears that, if a conversation occurred at 
the  pre-speech reception,  it was  a  brief one conducted  in public view,  similar to  the exchange 
between Kushner and Kislyak.

The Office found no evidence that Kislyak conversed with either Trump or Sessions after 
the speech, or would have had the opportunity to do  so.  Simes, for example, did not recall seeing 
Kislyak  at  the  post-speech  luncheon,632  and  the  only  witness  who  accounted  for  Sessions's 
whereabouts stated that Sessions may have spoken to the press after the event but then departed 
for Capitol Hill.633  Saunders recalled,  based in part on a food-related request he received from a 
Campaign  staff member,  that Trump  left the  hotel  a  few  minutes  after the  speech to  go to  the 
airport. 634 

c.  Jeff Sessions's Post-Speech Interactions with  CNI 

In the wake of Sessions' s confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about 
whether  Sessions's  campaign-period  interactions  with  CNI  apart  from  the  Mayflower speech 
included any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian-related matters. 
With respect to Kislyak contacts, on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI 's Distinguished Service 
Award dinner at the  Four Seasons Hotel  in Washington, D.C.635  Sessions attended a pre-dinner 
reception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event. 636  A seating chart prepared by 
Saunders indicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have 
responded to the invitation by indicating he would attend the event.637  Sessions, however, did not 
remember seeing, speaking with, or sitting next to Kislyak at the dinner.638  Although CNI board 
member Charles Boyd said he may have seen Kislyak at the dinner,639 Simes, Saunders, and Jacob 
Heilbrunn--editor of the National Interest-all had no recollection of seeing Kislyak at the May 
23  event.64° Kislyak also  does  not appear  in  any  of the photos  from  the event that the  Office 
obtained. 

In  the  summer  of 20 16,  CNI  organized  at least  two  dinners  in  Washington,  D.C.  for 
Sessions to meet with  experienced foreign  policy  professionals.64 1  The dinners  included  CNI(cid:173)
affiliated  individuals, such as Richard Burt and Zalmay Khalilzad,  a former U.S.  ambassador to 
Afghanistan and Iraq and the person who had introduced Trump before the April 27, 2016 foreign-

how U.S. relations with NATO and European countries affected U.S. policy toward Russia.644  But 
the  discussions  were  not  exclusively  focused  on  Russia.645  Khalilzad,  for  example,  recalled 
discussing "nation-building" and violent extremism with Sessions.646  In addition, Sessions asked 
Saunders ( of CNI) to draft two memoranda not specific to Russia:  one on Hillary Clinton' s foreign 
policy shortcomings and another on Egypt.647 

d.  Jared Kushner's -Continuing Contacts with Simes 

Between the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election, Jared 
Kushner had periodic contacts with Simes.648  Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings 
and  phone  conversations,  which  concerned  how  to  address  issues  relating  to  Russia  in  the 
Campaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes 
had proposed.649  Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and 
that Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.650  According 
to Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with 
Kushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and 
told  Kushner both that the  Campaign should not highlight Russia as  an issue and should handle 
any  contacts with Russians  with  care.651  Kushner  generally  provided a  similar account of his 
interactions with Simes.652 

Among the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes' s request, 
in  Kushner's New York office.  The meeting was to  address foreign policy advice that CNI was 
providing  and  how to  respond  to the  Clinton  Campaign's  Russia-related  attacks  on  candidate

(5/17/16 Email, Dearborn to Kushner (8: 12 a.m.)).  Copying Manafort and Gates, Kushner responded, "Pass 
on this.  A lot of people come claiming to carry messages.  Very few are able to verify.  For now I think we 
decline such meetings.  Most likely these people go back home and claim they have special access to gain 
importance for themselves.  Be careful."  NOSC00005653 (5/ 17/16 Email, Kushner to Dearborn).

Trump.653  In advance of the meeting,  Simes sent Kushner a  "Russia Policy Memo"  laying out 
"what Mr. Trump may want to say about Russia."654  In a cover email transmitting that memo and 
a  phone  call  to  set  up  the  meeting,  Simes  mentioned  "a  well-documented  story  of highly 
questionable connections between Bill Clinton" and the Russian government, "parts of [which]" 
(according to Simes) had even been "discussed with the CIA and the FBI  in  the late  1990s and 
shared  with  the  [Independent  Counsel]  at  the  end  of the  Clinton  presidency."655  Kushner 
forwarded the email to senior Trump Campaign officials Stephen Miller, Paul Manafort, and Rick 
Gates,  with  the  note  "suggestion only."656  Manafort  subsequently  forwarded  the  email to his 
assistant  and  scheduled  a  meeting  with  Simes.657 
(Manafort was  on  the  verge of leaving  the 
Campaign by the time of the scheduled meeting with Simes,  and Simes ended up  meeting only 
with Kushner). 

During the August 17 meeting,  Simes provided Kushner the Clinton-related information 

that he had  romised.658  Simes told Kushner that, 

Simes  claimed that he  had received this information from  former 
CIA and  Reagan White House official Fritz Ermarth,  who claimed to  have  learned  it from U.S. 
intelligence sources, not from  Russians.660 

Simes perceived that Kushner did  not find the information to  be of interest or use to the 
Campaign because  it was,  in  Simes's words,  "old news."661  When  interviewed  by the  Office, 
Kushner stated that he believed that there was little chance of something new being revealed about 
the  Clintons  given their  long career as  public figures,  and that he  never  received  from  Simes 
information  that  could  be  "operationalized"  for  the  Trump  Campaign.662  Despite  Kushner's

recommended "downplaying Russia as a U.S. foreign policy priority at this time" and suggested that "some 
tend to exaggerate Putin's  flaws."  The memorandum  also  recommended approaching general Russian(cid:173)
related  questions  in  the  framework  of "how  to  work  with  Russia  to  advance  important  U.S .  national 
interests"  and  that  a  Trump  Administration  "not  go  abroad  in  search  of monsters  to  destroy."  The 
memorandum did not discuss sanctions but did address how to handle Ukraine-related questions, including 
questions about Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea.

5.  June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower 

On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with 
a Russian attorney expecting to receive  derogatory  information about Hillary  Clinton from  the 
Russian government.  The meeting was proposed to  Donald Trump Jr.  in  an email from  Robert 
Goldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer 
Aras Agalarov.  Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the "Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered 
to  provide  the  Trump  Campaign  with  some  official  documents  and  information  that  would 
incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia" as "part of Russia and its government's support 
for Mr. Trump."  Trump Jr. immediately responded that "if it' s what you say I love it," and arranged 
the meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls. 

Trump Jr.  invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to 
attend the meeting, and both attended.  Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it 
occurred,  and Michael  Cohen recalled  that Trump Jr.  may  have  told  candidate Trump  about an 
upcoming meeting to receive adverse  information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to 
Russia.  According to written answers  submitted  by President Trump, he has  no recollection  of 
learning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he 
was made aware of the meeting--or its Russian connection-before it occurred. 

The  Russian  attorney  who  spoke  at the  meeting,  Natalia Veselnitskaya,  had  previously 
worked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout 
this period of time.  She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided 
to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.  Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but 
Veselnitskaya did not provide such information.  She and her associates then turned to a critique of 
the  origins  of the  Magnitsky Act,  a  2012  statute  that  imposed financial  and travel  sanctions  on 
Russian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. 
suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was  elected.  After the 
election,  Veselnitskaya  made  additional  efforts  to  follow  up  on  the  meeting,  but  the  Trump 
Transition Team did not engage.

-worked with Trump  in  connection with the  2013  Miss  Universe  pageant  in Moscow  and  a 
potential Trump Moscow real-estate project.665  The relationship continued over time, as the parties 
pursued the Trump Moscow project in 2013-2014 and exchanged gifts and letters in 2016.666  For 
example,  in  April  2016,  Trump  responded  to  a  letter  from  Aras  Agalarov  with  a  handwritten 
note.667  Aras Agalarov expressed interest in Trump's campaign, passed on "congratulations" for 
winning  in the  primary  and-according to  one  email  drafted  by  Goldstone-an "offer"  of his 
"support and  that  of many  of his  important Russian  friends  and  colleagues[,]  especially  with 
reference to U.S./Russian relations."668 

On June 3, 2016, Emin Agalarov called Goldstone, Emin' s then-publicist.669  Goldstone is 
·a music and events promoter who represented Emin Agalarov from approximately late 2012 until 
late  2016.670  While  representing  Emin  Agalarov,  Goldstone  facilitated  the  ongoing  contact 
between the Trumps and the Agalarovs-includin  an invitation that Trum  sent to Putin to attend 
the 2013  Miss Universe Pa  eant in Moscow.671

a

The 

mentioned  by  Emin  Agalarov  was  Natalia 
Veselnitskaya.  From approximately 1998 until 2001, Veselnitskaya worked as a prosecutor for 
the  Central Administrative District of the  Russian  Prosecutor's  Office,677  and  she  continued to 
perform  government-related  work and  maintain ties  to  the  Russian  government following  her 
departure.678  She  lobbied  and  testified  about  the  Magnitsky  Act,  which  imposed  financial 
sanctions  and  travel  restrictions  on Russian officials  and which  was  named  for  a  Russian  tax 
specialist who exposed a fraud and later died  in  a  Russian prison.679  Putin called the statute "a 
purely political, unfriendly act," and Russia responded by barring a list of current and former U.S. 
officials from entering Russia and by halting the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens.680 
Veselnitskaya performed legal  work for  Denis Katsyv,681  the son of Russian businessman Peter 
Katsyv, and for his company Prevezon Holdings Ltd., which was a defendant in a civil-forfeiture 
action  alleging the  laundering  of proceeds  from  the  fraud  exposed  by Magnitsky.682  She also 

675 

676  In December 2018, a  grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an indictment 
charging Veselnitskaya with obstructing the Prevezon litigation discussed in the text above.  See Indictment, 
United States v.  Natalia  Vladimirovna  Veselnitskaya,  No.  18-cr-904 (S.D.N.Y.).  The indictment alleges, 
among  other  things,  that  Veselnitskaya  lied  to  the  district court  about  her  relationship  to  the  Russian 
Prosecutor General's  Office  and  her involvement in responding to  a  U.S.  document request sent to the 
Russian government.

appears to have been  involved in an April 2016 approach to a  U.S.  congressional delegation in 
Moscow  offering  "confidential  information"  from  "the  Prosecutor  General  of Russia"  about 
"interactions between certain political forces in our two countries."683 

I 

Shortly  after  his  June 3  call  with Emin Agalarov, Goldstone emailed  Trump Jr.684  The 

email stated: 

Good morning 
Emln just called-and asked me to contact you with something very Interesting. 
The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered lo provide the Trump campaign with 
some official documents and information that would incriminate HIiiary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. 
This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and Its government's support for Mr. Trump -helped along by 
Aras and Emin. 
What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? 
I can also send this Info to your father via Rhona, but it Is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first. 
Best 
Rob Goldstone 

Within minutes of this email, Trump Jr. responded, emailing back:  "Thanks Rob I appreciate that. 
I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first.  Seems we have some time 
and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.  Could we do a call first thing next 
week when I am back?"685  Goldstone conveyed Trump Jr.'s interest to Emin Agalarov, emailing 
that Trump Jr. "wants to speak personally on the issue."686 

On June 6, 2016, Emin Agalarov asked Goldstone ifthere was "[a]ny news," and Goldstone 
explained that Trump Jr. was likely still traveling for the "final elections ... where [T]rurnp will 
be 'crowned' the official nominee."687  On the same day, Goldstone again emailed Trump Jr. and 
asked when Trump Jr. was "free to talk with Emin about this Hillary info."688  Trump Jr. asked if

On June 6 and June 7, Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov had multiple brief calls.690 

Also  on  June  6,  2016,  Aras Agalarov  called  Ike  Kaveladze  and  asked  him  to  attend  a 
meeting in New York with the Trump Organization.691  Kaveladze is a Georgia-born, naturalized 
U.S.  citizen  who  worked  in  the  United  States  for  the  Crocus  Group  and  reported  to  Aras 
Agalarov.692  Kaveladze told the Office that, in a second phone call on June 6, 2016, Aras Agalarov 
asked Kaveladze ifhe knew anything about the Magnitsky Act, and Aras sent him a short synopsis 
for the meeting and Veselnitskaya's business card.  According to  Kaveladze, Aras Agalarov said 
the  purpose  of the  meeting  was  to  discuss  the  Magnitsky  Act,  and  he  asked  Kaveladze  to 
translate. 693 

ii. Awareness of the Meeting Within the Campaign 

On  June  7,  Goldstone  emailed  Trump  Jr.  and  said that  "Emin  asked  that I  schedule  a 
meeting with you  and [t]he Russian government attorney who  is  flying  over from  Moscow."694 
Trump Jr.  replied that Manafort (identified as the "campaign boss"), Jared Kushner, and Trump 
Jr. would likely attend.695  Go~d  to learn that Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner 
would attend.696  Kaveladze - - - "puzzled" by the  list of attendees  and that he 
checked with one of Emin Agalarov's assistants, Roman Beniaminov, who said that the purpose 
of the  meeting  was  for  Veselnitskaya  to  convey  "negative  information  on  Hillary  Clinton."697 
Beniaminov, however, stated that he did not recall having known or said that.698

senior campaign staff and Trump family members that he had a lead on negative information about 
the Clinton Foundation.703  Gates believed that Trump Jr. said the information was coming from a 
group in  Kyrgyzstan and  that he  was introduced to the group by a  friend. 704  Gates recalled that 
the meeting was attended by Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Paul Manafort, Hope Hicks, and, joining late, 
Ivanka  Trump  and  Jared  Kushner.  According  to  Gates,  Manafort warned  the  group  that the 
meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful.705  Hicks denied any 
knowledge of the June 9 meeting before 2017,706 and Kushner did not recall if the planned June 9 
meeting came up at all earlier that week.707 

Michael Cohen recalled being in Donald J. Trump' s office on June 6 or 7 when Trump Jr. 
told his  father that a meeting to obtain adverse information about Clinton was going forward. 708 
Cohen did not recall Trump Jr. stating that the meeting was connected to Russia.709  From the tenor 
of the conversation, Cohen believed that Trump Jr. had previously discussed the meeting with his 
father,  although Cohen was not involved in any such conversation.710 
In an  interview with the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, however, Trump Jr. stated that he did not inform his father about the

b.  The Events of June 9, 2016 

i.  Arrangements for the Meeting 

Veselnitskaya was in New York on June 9, 2016, for appellate proceedings in the Prevezon 
civil forfeiture liti  ation.714 That da  , Veselnitskaya called Rinat Akhmetshin, a  Soviet-born U.S. 
lobbyist, 
and when she learned that he was in New York,  invited him 
to  lunch. 
Akhmetshin told the Office that he had worked on issues relating to the Magnitsky 
Act  and  had  worked  on  the  Prevezon  litigation.716  Kaveladze  and  Anatoli  Samochornov,  a

(Sept. 7, 2017).  The Senate Judiciary Committee interview was not under oath, but Trump Jr. was advised 
that it is a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 to make materially false statements in a congressional investigation.

(c)).  We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous 
knowledge of the June 9 meeting.  On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give "a major speech" 
"probably  Monday of next week"-which would have been June 13-about "all of the things that have 
taken place with the Clintons."  See,  e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, 
Washington Post (Aug. 7, 2018).  Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned 
speech to national security.  But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was 
connected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that 
meeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton.  Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting 
on June 12, could well have caused the change.  The President's written answers to our questions state that 
the speech's focus was altered ''[i]n light of' the Pulse nightclub shooting.  See Written Responses, supra. 
As for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that "he expected to give a speech referencing 
the publicly available, negative inf01mation about the Clintons," and that the draft of the speech prepared 
by Campaign staff"was based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the 
book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer."  Written Responses, supra.  In a later June 22 speech, Trump did 
speak extensively about allegations that Clinton was  corrupt,  drawing from  the Clinton Cash  book.  See

Goldstone recalled that Trump Jr.  invited Veselnitskaya to begin but did not 
say anything about the subject of the meeting.725  Participants agreed that Veselnitskaya stated that

Campaign.726  She asserted that the Ziff brothers had engaged in tax evasion and money laundering

in both the  United  States and  Russia,727 

728  According  to  Akhmetshin,  Trump  Jr.  asked  follow-up 
questions about how the alleged payments could be tied specifically to the Clinton Campaign, but 
Veselnitskaya  indicated that she could  not trace  the  money once  it entered the United States.729 
Kaveladze similarly recalled that Trump Jr. asked what they have on Clinton, and Kushner became 
aggravated and asked "[w]hat are we doing here?"730 

Akhmetshin  then  spoke  about  U.S.  sanctions  imposed  under  the  Magnitsky  Act  and 
Russia's response prohibiting U.S. adoption of Russian children.731  Several participants recalled 
that Trump Jr.  commented that Trump is a private citizen, and there was nothing they could do at 
that  time.732  Trump  Jr.  also  said  that  they  could  revisit  the  issue  if  and  when  they  were  in 
government.733  Notes that Manafort took on his phone reflect the general flow of the conversation, 
although not all of its details.734 

At some point in the meeting, Kushner sent an iMessage to Manafort stating "waste of time," 
followed immediately by two separate emails to assistants at Kushner Companies with requests that

they call him to give him an excuse to  leave.735  Samochornov recalled that Kushner departed the 
meeting before it concluded;  Veselnitskaya recalled  the  same when  interviewed by the press in 
July 2017. 736 

Veselnitskaya' s press interviews and written statements to Congress differ materially from 
other accounts.  In a July 2017 press interview, Veselnitskaya claimed that she has no connection 
to  the Russian  government and had not referred to  any derogatory  information  concerning the 
Clinton Campaign when she met with Trump Campaign officials.737  Veselnitskaya's November 
2017 written submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that the purpose of the June 9 
meeting was not to connect with "the Trump Campaign" but rather to have "a private meeting with 
Donald Trump Jr.-a friend of my good acquaintance's son on the matter of assisting me or my 
colleagues  in  informing the  Congress  members  as  to  the  criminal  nature  of manipulation  and 
interference with the  legislative activities of the US Congress."738  In other words, Veselnitskaya 
claimed her focus  was on Congress and not the  Campaign.  No witness,  however,  recalled any 
reference to Congress during the meeting.  Veselnitskaya also maintained that she "attended the 
meeting as a lawyer of Denis Katsyv," the pr,eviously mentioned owner of Prevezon Holdings, but 
she did not "introduce [her]self in this capacity."739 

In a July 2017 television interview, Trump Jr. stated that while he had no way to gauge the 
reliability, credibility, or accuracy of what Goldstone had stated was the purpose of the meeting, 
if "someone has  information on our opponent ... maybe this  is  something.  I should hear them 
out."740  Trump Jr. fu1ther stated in September 2017 congressional testimony that he thought he 
should  "listen  to  what  Rob  and  his  colleagues  had  to  say."741  Depending  on  what,  if any, 
information  was  provided,  Trump  Jr.  stated  he  could  then  "consult  with  counsel  to  make  an 
informed decision as to whether to give it any further consideration."742

Veselnitskaya next to him, Kaveladze reported that the meeting had gone well, but he later told 
Aras Agalarov that the meeting about the Magnitsky Act had been a waste of time because it was 
not with lawyers and they were "preaching to the wrong crowd."748 

c.  Post-June 9 Events 

Veselnitskaya and Aras Agalarov made at least two unsuccessful attempts after the election 
to  meet  with  Trump  representatives  to  convey  similar  information  about  Browder  and  the 
Magnitsky Act.749  On November 23, 2016, Kaveladze emailed Goldstone about setting up another 
meeting "with T  people" and sent a  document bearing allegations similar to those conveyed on 
June  9.75°  Kaveladze  followed  up  with  Goldstone,  stating  that  "Mr.  A ,"  which  Goldstone 
understood to  mean Aras Agalarov,  called to ask about the  meeting.751  Goldstone  emailed the

in New York currently and happy to meet with any member of his transition team."752  According 
to Goldstone, around January 2017, Kaveladze contacted him again to set up another meeting, but 
Goldstone did not make the request.753  The investigation did not identify evidence of the transition 
team following up. 

Participants  in  the  June  9,  2016  meeting  began  rece1vmg  inqumes  from  attorneys 
representing the Trump Organization starting in approximately June 2017. 754  On approximately 
June 2,  2017,  Goldstone  spoke with Alan  Garten,  general  counsel  of the  Trump  Organization, 
about his participation in the June 9 meeting.755  The same day, Goldstone emailed Veselnitskaya' s 
name to Garten, identifying her as the "woman who was the attorney  who spoke  at the  meeting 
from Moscow. "756  Later in June 2017, Goldstone participated in a lengthier call with Garten and 
Alan Futerfas, outside counsel for the Trump Organization (and, subsequently, personal counsel 
for Trump Jr.).757  On June 27, 2017, Goldstone emailed Emin Agalarov with the subject "Trump 
attorneys" and stated that he was "interviewed by attorneys"  about the June 9 meeting who were 
"concerned  because  it  links  Don  Jr.  to  officials  from  Russia-which  he  has  always  denied 
meeting."758  Goldstone stressed that he "did say at the time this was an awful  idea and a terrible 
meeting." 759  Emin Agalarov sent a screenshot of the message to Kaveladze.760 

The June 9 meeting became public in July 2017.  In a July 9, 2017 text message to  Emin 
Agalarov, Goldstone wrote "I made sure I kept you and your father out of [t]his story,"76 1 and "[i]f 
contacted I can do a dance and keep you out of it." 762  Goldstone added, "FBI now investigating," 
and "I hope this favor was worth for  your dad-it could blow up." 763  On July  12,  2017 Emin 
Agalarov  complained to  Kaveladze that his  father,  Aras,  "never listens"  to  him  and that their

relationship  with  "mr  T  has  been  thrown  down  the  drain."764  The  next  month,  Goldstone 
commented to Emin Agalarov about the volume of publicity the June 9 meeting had  generated, 
stating that his "reputation  [was]  basically  destroyed  by this  dumb  meeting  which your father 
insisted on even though  Ike and Me told him would be  bad  news and not to  do."765  Goldstone 
added, "I am not able to respond out of courtesy to you and your father.  So am painted as some 
mysterious link to Putin."766 

After  public  reporting  on  the  June  9  meeting  began,  representatives  from  the  Trump 
Organization again reached out to participants.  On July 10, 2017, Futerfas sent Goldstone an email 
with a proposed statement for Goldstone to issue, which read: 

As the person who arranged the meeting, I can definitively state that th~ statements I have 
read by Donald Trump Jr. are 100% accurate.  The meeting was a complete waste of time 
and Don was never told Ms. Veselnitskaya' s name prior to the meeting.  Ms. Veselnitskaya 
mostly talked about the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoption laws and the meeting lasted 
20 to 30  minutes at most.  There was never any follow up and nothing ever came of the 
meeting.767 

the  statement  drafted  by  Trump  Organization  representatives  was 
768  He proposed a different statement, asserting that he had been 
asked "by [his]  client in Moscow - Emin Agalarov - to  facilitate a  meeting  between a  Russian 
attorney (Natalia Veselnitzkaya  [sic])  and Donald Trump Jr.  The  lawyer had apparently stated 
that she had some information regarding funding to the DNC from Russia, which she believed Mr. 
Trump Jr. might find interesting."769  Goldstone never released either statement.770 

On the Russian end, there were also communications about what participants should say 

about  the  June  9  meeting.  Specifically,  the  organization  that  hired  Samochornov- an  anti(cid:173)
Magnitsky  Act group  controlled by  Veselnitskaya and the owner of Prevezon-offered to pay 
$90,000  of Samochornov' s  legal  fees.771  At  Veselnitskaya's  request,  the  organization  sent 
Samochornov a transcript of a Veselnitskaya press interview, and Samochornov understood that 
the  organization  would  pay  his  legal  fees  only  if ·he  made  statements  consistent  with 
Veselnitskaya's.772  Samochornov  declined,  telling  the  Office  that  he  did  not  want to  perjure

himself.773  The individual who conveyed Veselnitskaya' s request to Samochornov stated that he 
did  not  expressly  condition  payment  on  following  Veselnitskaya' s  answers  but,  in  hindsight, 
recognized  that  by  sending  the  transcript,  Samochornov  could  have  interpreted  the  offer  of 
assistance to be conditioned on his not contradicting Veselnitskaya's account.774 

Volume II, Section 11.G, infra, discusses interactions between President Trump, Trump Jr., 

and others in June and July 2017 regarding the June 9 meeting. 

6.  Events at the Republican National Convention 

Trump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week 
of the Republican National Convention.  The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief 
and non-substantive.  During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention, 
J.D.  Gordon,  a  senior  Campaign  advisor  on  policy  and  national  security,  diluted  a  proposed 
amendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing "lethal" assistance 
to  Ukraine  in  response  to  Russian  aggression.  Gordon  requested  that  platform  committee 
personnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only "appropriate" assistance be provided 
to Ukraine.  The original sponsor of the "lethal" assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her 
(the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his  request to 
dilute  the  language.  Gordon  denied  making  that  statement  to  the  sponsor,  although  he 
acknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the 
subject matter.  The investigation did  not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the 
candidate to make that proposal.  Gordon said that he sought the change because he  believed the 
proposed language was inconsistent with Trump ' s position on Ukraine. 

a.  Ambassador Kislyak's Encounters with Senator Sessions and J.D. Gordon the 

Week of the RNC 

In July 2016, Senator Sessions and Gordon  spoke at the  Global  Partners in Diplomacy 
event, a conference co-sponsored by the State Department and the Heritage Foundation held  in 
the  Republican  National  Convention  (RNC  or 
Cleveland,  Ohio 
"Convention").775  Approximately 80 foreign ambassadors to the United States, including Kislyak, 
were invited to the conference.776 

the  same  week  as 

On July 20,  2016, Gordon and Sessions delivered their speeches at the conference.777  In 
his speech, Gordon stated in pertinent part that the United States should have better relations with

Russia.778  During Sessions's speech, he took questions from the audience, one of which may have 
been asked by Kislyak.779 • When the speeches concluded, several ambassadors lined up to greet 
the speakers.780  Gordon shook hands with Kislyak and reiterated that he had meant what he said 
in the speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.781  Sessions separately spoke with between 
six and  12 ambassadors, including Kislyak.782  Although Sessions stated during interviews with 
the Office that he had no specific recollection of what he discussed with Kislyak, he believed that 
the two spoke for only a few minutes and that they would have exchanged pleasantries and said 
some things about U.S.-Russia relations.783 

Later that evening, Gordon attended a reception as part of the conference.784  Gordon ran 
into Kislyak as the two prepared plates of food, and they decided to sit at the same table to eat.785 
They were joined at that table by the ambassadors from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and by Trump 
Campaign  advisor  Carter  Page.786  As  they  ate,  Gordon  and  Kislyak  talked  for  what Gordon 
estimated to have been three to five minutes, during which Gordon again mentioned that he meant 
what he said in his speech about improving U.S.-Russia relations.787 

b.  Change to Republican Party Platform 

In preparation for the 2016 Convention, foreign policy advisors to the Trump Campaign, 
working with the Republican National Committee, reviewed the 2012 Convention's foreign policy 
platform to identify divergence between the earlier platform and candidate Trump' s  positions.788 
The Campaign team discussed toning down language from the 2012 platform that identified Russia 
as the country's number one threat, given the candidate's belief that there needed to be better U.S. 
relations  with  Russia. 789  The  RNC  Platform  Committee  sent  the  2016  draft  platform  to  the 
National Security and Defense Platform Subcommittee on July  10, 2016, the evening before its

first meeting to propose amendments.7
0 
~

Although only delegates could participate in formal discussions and vote on the platform, 
the  Trump  Campaign  could  request  changes,  and  members  of the  Trump  Campaign attended 
committee  meetings.791 
John  Mashburn,  the  Campaign's  policy  director,  helped  oversee  the 
Campaign's  involvement  in  the  platform  committee  meetings.792  He  told  the  Office  that  he 
directed Campaign staff at the  Convention, including J.D.  Gordon, to take a  hands-off approach 
and only to challenge platform planks if they directly contradicted Trump 's wishes.793 

On July 11, 2016, delegate Diana Denman submitted a proposed platform amendment that 
included provision of armed support for Ukraine. 794  The amendment described Russia's "ongoing 
military  aggression"  in Ukraine  and announced "supp01t"  for  "maintaining  (and,  if warranted, 
increasing) sanctions against Russia until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial  integrity are fully 
restored"  and  for  "providing  lethal  defensive  weapons  to  Ukraine' s  armed  forces  and  greater 
coordination  with  NA TO  on  defense  planning."795  Gordon  reviewed  the  proposed  platform 
changes,  including  Denman's.796  Gordon  stated  that  he  flagged  this  amendment  because  of 
Trump's stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March 
31  foreign policy meeting-namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any 
assistance  to  Ukraine, that there should  be  improved U.S.-Russia relations,  and that he  did  not 
want to start World War III over that region. 797  Gordon told the Office that Trump's statements 
on the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored those positions to the point where 
Gordon felt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seek its dilution.798 

On  July  11 ,  2016,  at  a  meeting  of  the  National  Security  and  Defense  Platform 
Subcommittee, Denman offered her amendment.799  Gordon and another Campaign staffer, Matt 
Miller, approached a committee co-chair and asked him to table the amendment to permit further 
discussion.800  Gordon's concern with the amendment was the  language about providing "lethal

defensive weapons to Ukraine."801  Miller did not have any independent basis to believe that this 
language  contradicted  Trump's  views  and  relied  on  Gordon's  recollection  of the  candidate' s 
views.802 

According to Denman, she spoke with Gordon and Matt Miller, and they told her that they 
had to clear the language and that Gordon was "talking to New York."803  Denman told others that 
she was asked by the two Trump Campaign staffers to strike "lethal defense weapons" from the 
proposal but that she refused. 804  Demnan recalled Gordon saying that he was on the phone with 
candidate  Trump,  but she was  skeptical whether  that was true.805  Gordon  denied  having  told 
Denman that he was on the phone with Trump, although he acknowledged it was possible that he 
mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the subject matter.806  Gordon's phone 
records reveal  a call to Sessions's office  in  Washington that afternoon,  but do  not include calls 
directly to a number associated with Trump.807  And according to the President's written answers 
to  the  Office's  questions,  he  does  not recall  being  involved  in  the  change  in  language  of the 
platform amendment. 808 

Gordon stated that he tried to reach Rick Dearborn, a senior foreign  policy advisor,  and 
Mashburn, the Campaign policy director.  Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he 
could not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in 
the proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that 
all  three  Campaign advisors  supported the alternative formulation  ("appropriate assistance").809 
Dearborn  recalled  Gordon  warning  them  about  the  amendment,  but  not  weighing  in  because 
Gordon was more familiar with the Campaign's foreign policy stance.810  Mashburn stated that 
Gordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that 
the Campaign should not intervene.811 

When the amendment came up again in the committee's proceedings, the subcommittee 
changed the amendment by striking the "lethal defense weapons" language and replacing it with

"appropriate  assistance."812  Gordon  stated  that  he  and  the  subcommittee  co-chair  ultimately 
agreed  to  replace  the  language  about  armed  assistance  with  "appropriate  assistance."8 13  The 
subcommittee  accordingly  approved  Denman's  amendment  but  with  the  term  "appropriate 
assistance."814  Gordon  stated that,  to  his  recollection,  this was  the  only  change  sought by the 
Campaign.815  Sam Clovis, the  Campaign's national  co-chair and  chief policy advisor, stated he 
was surprised by the change and did not believe it was in line with Trump's stance.81 6  Mashburn 
stated that when he saw the word "appropriate assistance,"  he believed that Gordon had violated 
Mashburn's directive not to intervene.8 17 

7.  Post-Convention Contacts with Kislyak 

Ambassador  Kislyak  continued  his  efforts  to  interact  with  Campaign  officials  with 
responsibility for the foreign-policy portfolio-among them Sessions and Gordon-in the weeks 
after the  Convention.  The Office did not identify evidence in those interactions of coordination 
between the Campaign and the Russian government. 

a.  Ambassador Kislyak Invites J.D.  Gordon  to Breakfast at the Ambassador's 

Residence 

On August 3, 2016, an official from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the United 
States  wrote  to  Gordon  "[ o ]n  behalf  of'  Ambassador  Kislyak  inviting  Gordon  "to  have 
breakfast/tea with the Ambassador at his residence"  in Washington, D.C. the following week. 818 
Gordon responded five days later to decline the invitation.  He wrote, "[t]hese days are not optimal 
for us, as we are busily knocking down a constant stream of false media stories while also preparing 
for the first debate with HRC.  Hope to take a raincheck for another time when things quiet down 
a bit.  Please pass along my regards to  the  Ambassador." 819  The investigation did not identify 
evidence that Gordon made any other arrangements to meet ( or met) with Kislyak after this email. 

b.  Senator Sessions's September 2016 Meeting with Ambassador Kislyak 

Also in August 2016, a representative of the Russian Embassy contacted Sessions' s Senate 
office about setting up  a meeting with  Kislyak. 820  At the time,  Sessions was  a  member of the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee and would meet with foreign officials in that capacity.82 1  But 
Sessions's  staff  reported,  and  Sessions  himself  acknowledged,  that  meeting  requests  from 
ambassadors increased substantially in 2016, as Sessions assumed a prominent role in the Trump 
Campaign  and  his  name  was  mentioned  for  potential  cabinet-level  positions  in  a  future 
Trump  Administration. 822 

On September 8, 2016,  Sessions met with Kislyak in his Senate office. 823  Sessions said 
that he  believed  he  was  doing  the  Campaign  a  service  by  meeting  with foreign  ambassadors, 
including Kislyak. 824  He  was  accompanied  in the meeting  by  at  least two  of his  Senate  staff: 
Sandra  Luff,  his  legislative  director;  and Pete  Landrum,  who  handled  military  affairs.825  The 
meeting lasted less than 30 minutes. 826  Sessions voiced concerns about Russia's sale of a missile(cid:173)
defense system to Iran, Russian planes buzzing U.S. military assets in the Middle East, and Russian 
aggression  in  emerging  democracies  such  as  Ukraine  and  Moldova. 827  Kislyak  offered 
explanations  on  these  issues  and  complained  about  NA TO  land  forces  in  former  Soviet-bloc 
countries  that  border  Russia. 828  Landrum  recalled  that  Kislyak  referred  to  the  presidential 
campaign  as  "an  interesting  campaign,"829  and  Sessions  also  recalled  Kislyak  saying  that  the 
Russian  government was receptive to  the overtures Trump had  laid out during his  campaign.830 
None of the attendees, though, remembered any discussion of Russian election interference or any 
request that Sessions convey information from the Russian government to the Trump Campaign. 831 

During the meeting, Kislyak invited Sessions to further discuss U.S.-Russia relations with 
him over a  meal at the ambassador's  residence. 832  Sessions was non-committal when Kislyak 
extended the invitation.  After the meeting ended, Luff advised Sessions against accepting the one(cid:173)
on-one meeting with Kislyak, whom she assessed to be an "old school KGB guy."833  Neither Luff 
nor Landrum recalled that Sessions followed up on the invitation or made any further effort to dine

or meet with Kislyak before the November 2016 election.834  Sessions and Landrum recalled that, 
after the election, some efforts were made to arrange a meeting between Sessions and Kislyak.835 
According to Sessions, the request came through CNI and would have involved a meeting between 
Sessions  and  Kislyak,  two  other  ambassadors,  and  the  Governor  of Alabama. 836  Sessions, 
however, was in New York on the day of the anticipated meeting and was unable to attend.837  The 
investigation did not identify evidence that the two men met at any point after their September 8 
meeting. 

8.  Paul Manafort 

Paul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman, 
from March to  August 2016.838  Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for 
Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. 
Manafort  stayed  in  touch  with  these  contacts  during  the  campaign period  through  Konstantin 
Kilimnik, a  longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort's office in Kiev and who 
the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. 

Manafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee, 839 
to  provide  Kilimnik  with  updates  on  the  Trump  Campaign-including  internal  polling  data, 
although Manafort claims not to  recall that specific instruction.  Manafort expected Kilimnik to 
share that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska.  Gates periodically sent such 
polling data to Kilimnik during the campaign.

838  On August 21, 2018,  Manafo1t was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax, 
Foreign Bank Account Registration (FBAR),  and bank fraud charges.  On September 14, 2018, Manafort 
pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to 
commit  offenses  against  the  United  States  (money  laundering,  tax  fraud,  FBAR,  Foreign  Agents 
Registration Act (FARA),  and  FARA  false  statements),  and (2)  conspiracy  to  obstruct justice (witness 
tampering).  Manafort also  admitted  criminal  conduct  with which he  had  been  charged  in  the  Eastern 
District of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung.  The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort's 
work in  Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended. 
On March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution.  On 
March 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafo1t to a total term of 73 months:  60 months on the 
Count 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on 
the Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences.  The two sentences resulted in 
a total term of 90 months. 

839  As noted in Volume I, Section III.D. l .b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in 
the District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement.  He 
has  provided  information  and  in-court  testimony  that the  Office  has  deemed  to  be reliable.  See  also

Manafort also  twice  met Kilimnik in the United  States during the  campaign period  and 
conveyed campaign information.  The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York 
City.  Kilimnik  requested  the  meeting  to  deliver  in  person  a  message  from  former  Ukrainian 
President Viktor Y anukovych,  who  was then living in  Russia.  The message  was about a  peace 
plan for Ukraine that Manafort has  since acknowledged was a "backdoor"  means for Russia to 
control eastern Ukraine.  Several months later,  after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an 
email  to  Manafort  expressing the  view-which Manafort  later  said  he  shared-that the plan' s 
success would require U.S.  support to succeed:  "all that is required to start the process is a very 
minor ' wink'  ( or slight push) from  [Donald Trump ]."840  The email also stated that if Manafort 
were designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his 
reception in Russia "at the very top level." 

Manafort communicated with  Kilimnik about peace  plans  for  Ukraine  on  at least  four 
occasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2:  December 2016 (the Kilimnik email 
described  above);  January 2017;  February 2017;  and  again  in the  spring of 2018.  The  Office 
reviewed  numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about 
the plan in written questions.841  The investigation did not uncover evidence ofManafort's passing 
along information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or 
the  Administration.  The  Office  was  not,  however,  able  to  gain  access  to  all  of Manafort' s 
electronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications). 
And  while  Manafort  denied  that  he  spoke  to  members  of the  Trump  Campaign  or the  new 
Administration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan 
and his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that 
the district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement. 842 

The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's  ur  ose in sharin 

did not see 
with Kilimnik during the campaign period.  Manafort 
a downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would

841  According to the President's written answers, he does not remember Manafort communicating 
to him any particular positions that Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to support.  Written 
Responses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 16-17 (Response to Question IV, Part (d)). 

842  Manafort made several false  statements during debriefings.  Based on that conduct, the Office 
determined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness.  The 
judge presiding in Manafort's D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort 
intentionally made  multiple  false  statements  to  the FBI,  the  Office,  and  the grand jury  concerning  his 
interactions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues).  Although the  report 
refers at times to Manafort' s statements, it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated 
to  be  trustworthy,  to  identify  issues  on  which  Manafort's  untruthful  responses  may  themselves  be  of 
evidentiary value, or to provide Manafort's explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to 
determine whether that explanation was credible.

be "good for business" and potentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed 
in the Ukraine.  As  to  Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by  sharing campaign  information with 
him, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a "disagreement"-a reference to 
one  or more  outstanding  lawsuits.  Because  of questions  about  Manafort' s  credibility  and  our 
limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, 
the  Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given  it to) did with it.  The 
Office  did  not  identify  evidence of a  connection  between Manafort' s  sharing polling  data and 
Russia's interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the 
time  of the  August  2  meeting.  The  investigation  did  not  establish  that  Manafort  otherwise 
coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. 

a.  Paul Manafort's Ties to Russia and Ukraine 

Manafort' s  Russian  contacts  during  the  campaign  and  transition  periods  stem  from  his 
consulting  work  for  Deripaska  from  approximately  2005  to  2009  and  his  separate  political 
consulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company Dl\1P International 
LLC (DMI).  Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this  entire period and continued to 
communicate  with  Manafort  through  at  least  June  2018.  Kilimnik,  who  speaks  and  writes 
Ukrainian  and  Russian,  facilitated  many  of Manafort's  communications  with  Deripaska  and 
Ukrainian oligarchs. 

i. 

Oleg Deripaska Consulting Work 

In  approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian  oligarch who 
has a  global empire  involving aluminum and power companies  and who is closely aligned with 
Vladimir Putin.843  A  memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for  Deripaska  in 
2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits 
that the work could confer on "the Putin Government."844  Gates described the work Manafort did 
for Deripaska as "political risk insurance," and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install 
friendly  political  officials  in  countries  where  Deripaska  had  business  interests.845  Manafort's 
company earned tens of millions of dollars from  its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions 
of dollars by Deripaska as well.846 

In 2007,  Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners 
L.P. ("Pericles"), an investment fund  created  by Manafort and former Manafort business partner 
Richard  Davis.  The Pericles  fund  was  established  to  pursue  investments  in  Eastern  Europe.847 
Deripaska was the sole investor. 848  Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led

to  a deterioration of the relationship between Manafort and Deripaska.849  In pa1ticular, when the 
fund  failed,  litigation  between  Manafort  and  Deripaska  ensued.  Gates  stated  that,  by  2009, 
Manafort's business relationship with Deripaska had "dried up."850  According to  Gates, various 
interactions with Deripaska and his intermediaries over the past few years have involved trying to 
resolve the legal dispute. 851  As described below, in 2016, Manafort, Gates, Kilimnik, and others 
engaged in efforts to revive the Deripaska relationship and resolve the litigation. 

ii. 

Political Consulting Work 

Through Deripaska,  Manafort was introduced to  Rinat Akhmetov,  a  Ukrainian  oligarch 
who hired Manafort as a political consultant.852  In 2005, Akhmetov hired Manafort to engage in 
political work supporting the Party of Regions,853  a political party in Ukraine that was generally 
understood to align with Russia.  Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and 
its  candidate, Viktor Yanukovych,  won the presidency in  2010.  Manafort  became a  close and 
trusted political advisor to  Y anukovych during his  time  as  President of Ukraine.  Y anukovych 
served in that role until 2014, when he fled to Russia amidst popular protests.854 

iii. 

Konstantin Kilimnik 

Kilimnik  is  a  Russian  national  who  has  lived  in  both  Russia  and  Ukraine  and  was  a 
longtime  Manafort employee.855  Kilimnik  had  direct and  close access  to  Yanukovych  and  his 
senior entourage, and he facilitated communications between Manafort and his clients, including 
Yanukovych and multiple Ukrainian oligarchs.856  Kilimnik  also  maintained a relationship with 
Deripaska's deputy, Viktor Boyarkin,857 a Russian national who previously served in the defense 
attache office of the Russian Embassy to the United States.858

Manafort  told  the  Office  that  he  did  not  believe  Kilimnik  was  working  as  a  Russian 
"spy."859  The FBI, however, assesses  that Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence.860  Several 
pieces of the Office' s evidence-including witness interviews and emails obtained through court(cid:173)
authorized search warrants-support that assessment: 

•  Kilimnik was born on April 27, 1970, in Dnipropetrovsk Ob last, then of the Soviet Union, 
and attended the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense from 1987 until 1992.861  Sam 
Patten,  a  business  partner  to  Kilimnik,862  stated  that Kilimnik  told  him  that  he  was  a 
translator  in  the Russian army  for  seven  years  and that  he  later worked  in  the Russian 
armament industry selling arms and military equipment. 863 

•  U.S.  government visa records reveal that Kilimnik obtained a visa to travel to the United 

States with a Russian diplomatic passport in 1997. 864 

•  Kilimnik worked for the International Republican Institute' s (IRI) Moscow office, where 
he  did  translation  work  and  general  office  management  from  1998  to  2005.865  While 
another official recalled the incident differently,866  one former associate of Kilimnik's at 
TRI  told  the  FBI  that  Kilimnik  was  fired  from  his  post  because  his  links  to  Russian 
intelligence were too strong.  The same individual stated that it was well known at IRI that 
Kilimnik had links to the Russian government.867 

• 

Jonathan  Hawker,  a  British  national  who  was  a  public  relations  consultant  at  FTI 
Consulting,  worked  with  DMI  on a  public  relations  campaign  for  Yanukovych.  After

b.  Contacts during Paul Manafort's Time with the Trump Campaign 

i.  Paul Manafort Joins the Campaign 

Manafort served on the Trump Campaign from  late March to August 19, 2016.  On March 
29, 2016, the Campaign announced that Manafort would  serve as the Campaign's "Convention 
Manager."871  On  May  19,  2016,  Manafort  was  promoted  to  campaign  chairman  and  chief 
strategist, and Gates,  who had been assisting Manafort on the Campaign, was appointed deputy 
campaign chairman.872 

Thomas Barrack and Roger Stone both recommended Manafort to candidate Trump. 873  In 
early 2016, at Manafort' s request, Barrack suggested to Trump that Mana fort join the Campaign 
to manage the Republican Convention.874  Stone had worked with Manafort from  approximately 
1980 until the mid- l 990s through various consulting and lobbying firms.  Manafort met Trump in 
1982 when Trump hired the Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lobbying firm. 875  Over the years, 
Manafort saw Trump at political and social events in New York City and at Stone's wedding, and 
Trump requested VIP status at the 1988 and 1996 Republican conventions worked by Manafort. 876

According to  Gates,  in March 2016, Manafort traveled to  Trump's Mar-a-Lago  estate in 
Florida to  meet with Trump.  Trump  hired him at that time. 877  Manafort agreed to work on the 
Campaign without pay.  Manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time, but resuscitating 
his domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future.  Gates reported 
that Manafort intended,  if Trump won the  Presidency, to remain outside the Administration and 
monetize his relationship with the Administration. 878 

ii.  Paul Manafort's Campaign-Period Contacts 

Immediately upon joining the Campaign, Manafort directed Gates to prepare for his review 
separate  memoranda  addressed  to  Deripaska,  Akhmetov,  Serhiy  Lyovochkin,  and  Boris 
Kolesnikov,879  the  last  three  being  Ukrainian  oligarchs  who  were  senior  Opposition  Bloc 
officials. 880  The  memoranda  described  Manafort' s  appointment  to  the  Trump  Campaign  and 
indicated his willingness to consult on Ukrainian politics in the future.  On March 30, 2016, Gates 
emailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort' s appointment to  Kilimnik for 
translation and dissemination. 881  Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages 
had been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown "our friends" 
the media coverage of his new role. 882  Kilimnik replied, "Absolutely.  Every article."  Manafort 
further asked: "How do we use to  get whole. Has Ovd [Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska] operation 
seen?"  Kilimnik  wrote  back  the  same  day,  "Yes,  I  have  been  sending  everything  to  Victor 
[Boyarkin, Deripaska's deputy], who has been forwarding the coverage directly to OVD." 883 

Gates  reported that Manafort said that being hired  on the  Campaign would be "good for 
business" and  increase the  likelihood that Manafort would be  paid the  approximately $2 million 
he was  owed for  previous  political consulting work in Ukraine. 884  Gates  also  explained to  the 
Office that Manafort thought his role on the Campaign could help "confirm" that Deripaska had 
dropped the Pericles lawsuit, and that Gates believed Manafort sent polling data to Deripaska ( as

discussed  further  below)  so  that  Deripaska  would  not move  forward  with  his  lawsuit  against 
Manafort.885  Gates further stated that Deripaska wanted a visa to the United States, that Deripaska 
could believe that having Manafort in a position inside the Campaign or Administration might be 
helpful to Deripaska, and that Manafort's relationship with Trump could help Deripaska in other 
ways as well. 886  Gates stated, however, that Manafort never told him anything specific about what, 
if anything, Manafort might be offering Deripaska. 887 

Gates also reported that Manafort instructed him in April 2016 or early May 2016 to send 
Kilimnik Campaign internal polling data and other updates so that Kilimnik, in turn, could share 
it with Ukrainian oli  archs. 888  Gates understood that the information would also be shared with 
. 889  Gates reported to the Office 
Deripaska 
that he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it 
was  a way to showcase Manafort's work,  and Manafort wanted  to  open doors to jobs after the 
Trump  Campaign  ended. 890  Gates  said  that  Manafort's  instruction  included  sending  internal 
polling data prepared for the Trump Campaign by pollster Tony Fabrizio.891  Fabrizio had worked 
with Manafort for years and was brought into  the  Campaign by Manafort.  Gates stated that, in 
accordance with Manafort's instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; 
Gates then deleted the communications on a daily basis. 892  Gates further told the Office that, after 
Manafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and 
that the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data. 893

and  assessed  Trump' s  prospects  for 
Gates to send Kilimnik internal data, 

The Office  also  obtained contemporaneous emails  that shed  light on the purpose of the 
communications with Deripaska and that are  consistent with Gates' s  account.  For example,  in 
response to a  July 7, 20 I 6, email from a Ukrainian reporter about Manafort' s  failed Deripaska(cid:173)
backed investment, Manafort asked Kilimnik whether there had been any movement on "this issue 
with our friend."897  Gates stated that "our friend" likely referred to Deripaska,898  and Manafort 
told the Office that the "issue" (and "our biggest interest,"  as stated below) was a solution to the 
Deripaska-Pericles issue. 899  Kilimnik replied: 

I am carefully optimistic on the question of our biggest interest. 

Our friend [Boyarkin]  said there is lately significantly more attention to the campaign in 
his boss'  [Deripaska' s] mind, and he will be most likely  looking for ways to reach out to 
you pretty soon, understanding all the time sensitivity.  I am more than sure that it will be 
resolved and we will get back to the original relationship with V. 's boss [Deripaska].900 

Eight minutes  later, Manafort replied that Kilimnik should tell Boyarkin's " boss," a reference to 
Deripaska, "that if he needs private briefings we can accommodate."901  Manafort has alleged to 
the Office that he  was  willing to brief Deripaska only on public  campaign matters and gave an 
example:  why Trump selected  Mike Pence as  the  Vice-Presidential  running mate.902  Manafort 
said he never gave Deripaska a  briefing.903  Manafort noted that if Trump won, Deripaska would 
want to  use  Manafort to  advance  whatever  interests  Deripaska  had  in the  United  States  and 
elsewhere.904

iii.  Paul Manafort's Two Campaign-Period Meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik 

in the United States 

Manafort twice met with Kilimnik in person during the campaign period-once in  May 
and again in August 2016.  The first meeting took place on May 7, 2016, in New York City.905  In 
the  days  leading  to  the  meeting,  Kilimnik  had  been  working  to  gather  information  about the 
political situation in Ukraine.  That included information gleaned from  a trip that former Party of 
Regions official Yuriy Boyko had recently taken to Moscow-a trip that likely included meetings 
between Boyko and high-ranking Russian officials.906  Kilimnik then traveled to Washington, D.C. 
on or about May 5,  2016;  while in Washington, Kilimnik had pre-arranged meetings with State 
Department employees.907 

Late on the evening of May 6, Gates arranged for Kilimnik to take a 3:00 a.m. train to meet 
Mana fort in New York for breakfast on May 7. 908  According to Manafort, during the meeting, he 
and  Kilimnik  talked  about  events  in  Ukraine,  and  Manafort  briefed  Kilimnik  on  the  Trump 
Campaign,  expecting  Kilimnik  to  pass  the  information  back  to  individuals  in  Ukraine  and 
elsewhere.909  Manafort stated that Opposition Bloc members recognized Manafort' s position on 
the Campaign was an opportunity, but Kilimnik did not ask for anything. 91° Kilimnik spoke about 
a plan of Boyko to boost election participation in the eastern zone of Ukraine, which was the base 
for the Opposition Bloc.911  Kilimnik returned to Washington, D.C.  right after the meeting with 
Manafort. 

Manafort met with Kilimnik a second time at the Grand Havana Club in New York City 
on the evening of August 2, 2016.  The events leading to the meeting are as follows.  On July 28, 
2016,  Kilimnik  flew  from  Kiev  to  Moscow.912  The  next  day,  Kilimnik  wrote  to  Manafort 
requesting that they meet,  using coded language about a conversation he  had that day.913  In an 
email with a subject line "Black Caviar," Kilimnik wrote: 

I met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago. We 
spent about 5 hours talking about his story, and I  have several important messages  from 
him to you.  He asked me to go and brief you on our conversation.  I said I have to run it

country, and is quite interesting.914 

Manafort identified  "the guy who  gave  you your biggest black caviar jar" as  Yanukovych.  He 
explained that, in 2010, he and Y anukovych had lunch to celebrate the recent presidential election. 
Yanukovych gave Manafort a large jar of black caviar that was worth approximately $30,000 to 
$40,000. 915  Manafort's identification ofYanukovych as "the guy who gave you your biggest black 
caviar jar" is  consistent with  Kilimnik  being  in  Moscow-where Yanukovych  resided-when 
Kilimnik wrote "I met today w i th~  a December 2016 email  in which Kilimnik 
referred to Yanukovych as "BG , " -916  Manafort replied to Kilimnik's July 29 
email, "Tuesday [August 2]  is best . .. Tues or weds in NYC."9 17 

Three days later, on July 31, 2016, Kilimnik flew back to Kiev from Moscow, and on that 
same day, wrote to Manafort that he needed "about 2 hours" for their meeting "because it is a long 
caviar story to tell."918  Kilimnik wrote that he would arrive at JFK on August 2 at 7:30 p.m., and 
he and Manafort agreed to  a  late  dinner that night.919  Documentary evidence-
including flight, 
phone, and hotel records, and the timing of text messages exchanged920-confirms the dinner took 
place as planned on August 2.921 

As to the contents of the meeting itself, the accounts of Manafort and Gates-who arrived 
late to the dinner-differ in certain respects.  But their versions of events, when assessed alongside 
available documentary evidence and what Kilimnik told business associate Sam Patten, indicate 
that at least three principal topics were discussed. 

First, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a plan to resolve the ongoing political problems in 
Ukraine by creating an autonomous republic in its more industrialized eastern region ofDonbas,922

921  Deripaska' s private plane also flew to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on the evening of August 
2, 2016.  According to  Customs  and  Border Protection records, the only  passengers  on the plane were 
Deripaska's wife, daughter, mother, and father-in-law, and separate records obtained by our Office confirm 
that Kilimnik flew on a commercial flight to New York. 

922  The  Luhansk  and  Donetsk People's  Republics,  which  are  located  in  the  Donbas  region  of 
Ukraine, declared themselves independent in response to the popular unrest in 2014 that removed President 
Yanukovych from power.  Pro-Russian Ukrainian militia forces,  with backing from the Russian military, 
have  occupied  the  region  since  2014.  Under  the  Yanukovych-backed  plan,  Russia  would  assist  in 
withdrawing the military, and Donbas would become an autonomous region within Ukraine with its own

and having Yanukovych, the Ukrainian President ousted in 2014, elected to head that republic.923 
That plan,  Manafort later  acknowledged,  constituted a  "backdoor" means  for  Russia to  control 
eastern Ukraine.924  Manafort initially said that, if he had not cut off the discussion, Kilimnik would 
have asked Manafort in the August 2 meeting to convince Trump to come out in favor of the peace 
plan,  and  Yanukovych  would  have  expected  Manafort to  use  his  connections  in  Europe  and 
Ukraine to support the plan.925  Manafort also initially told the Office that he had said to Kilimnik 
that  the  plan was  crazy,  that the  discussion  ended,  and that  he  did not recall  Kilimnik askin 
Manafort to reconsider the  Ian after their Au  ust 2 meetin  .926  Manafort said 

that he reacted negatively to Yanukovych sending-years later-an "urgent" 
request when Yanukovych needed him.927  When confronted with an email written by Kilimnik on 
or about  December 8,  2016,  however,  Manafort acknowledged Kilimnik raised the peace  plan 
again in that email.928  Manafort ultimately acknowled  ed Kilimnik also raised the  eace  Ian in 
~ a ry  2017 meetings with Manafort 
. . . . . . . . . .  929 

Second, Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the state of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's 
plan to win the election.930  That briefing encompassed the Campaign's messaging and its internal 
polling  data.  According  to  Gates,  it  also  included  discussion  of "battleground"  states,  which 
Manafort identified as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.931  Manafort did not 
refer ex  licit! 

to "battle  round" states in his tellin  of the Au  ust 2 discussion, 

prime minister.  The plan emphasized that Yanukovych would be an ideal candidate to  bring peace to the 
region as prime minister of the republic, and facilitate the reintegration of the r e~ a in e  with the 
support  of the  U.S.  and  Russian  presidents.  As  noted  above,  according  to ~ the  written

Third, according to Gates and what Kilimnik told Patten, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed 
two sets of financial disputes related to Mana fort's previous work in the region.  Those consisted 
of the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the funds that the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafort for 
his political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment.933 

After the meeting, Gates and Manafort both. stated that they left separately from Kilimnik 
because they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his 
connections to Kilimnik.934 

c.  Post-Resignation Activities 

Manafort resigned from  the  Trump  Campaign  in  mid-August 2016,  approximately  two 
weeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political 
consulting  work  for  the  pro-Russian  Party  of Regions  in  Ukraine.  Despite  his  resignation, 
Manafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election. 
Manafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,935  and some 
of those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails.  For example, on October 21, 2016, 
Manafort  sent  Kushner  an  email  and  attached  a  strategy  memorandum  proposing  that  the 
Campaign make the case against Clinton "as the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment" 
and that "Wikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to  make the case in a very credible 
way - by  using the words  of Clinton,  its  campaign officials and DNC members."936  Later,  in a 
November 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled "Securing the Victory," Manafort stated that he was 
"really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory," and 
that he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by "mov[ing] immediately 
to  discredit the  [Trump]  victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that 
the Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results."937 

Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016.  Manafort told the Office that, in the 
wake  of Trump's  victory,  he  was  not  interested  in  an  Administration  job.  Manafort  instead 
preferred to stay on the "outside," and monetize his campaign position to generate business given 
his  familiarity  and  relationship  with  Trump  and  the  incoming  Administration.938  Manafort 
appeared to  follow that plan,  as  he traveled to  the Middle East,  Cuba,  South Korea,  Japan,  and 
China and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entaii.939 

Manafort' s activities in early 20 17 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.  The

first meeting,  which took place  in  Madrid,  Spain  in  January  2017, was  with Georgiy Oganov. 
Oganov, who  had previously worked at the Russian  Embassy in  the United States, was a  senior 
executive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to Deripaska.940  Manafort 
initially denied attending the meeting.  When he later acknowledged it, he claimed that the meeting 
had been  arranged  by his lawyers  and concerned  only the  Pericles  lawsuit.941  Other evidence, 
however, provides reason to doubt Manafort's statement that the sole topic of the meeting was the 
Pericles lawsuit.  In particular, text messages to Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik 
suggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin-not Manafort's counsel-had arranged the meeting between 
Manafort and Oganov.942  Kilimnik's message states that the meeting was  supposed to be "not 
about money or Pericles" but instead "about recreating [the] old friendship"-ostensibly between 
Manafort and Deripaska-"and talking about global politics."943  Manafort also replied by text that 
he "need[s] this finished before Jan. 20,"944  which appears to be a reference to resolving Pericles 
before the inauguration. 

On January  15,  2017,  three  days  after his  return  from  Madrid,  Manafort emailed K.T. 
McFarland,  who was  at that time  designated  to  be  Deputy  National  Security  Advisor and was 
formally  appointed  to  that  position  on January  20,  2017.945  Manafort' s  January  15  email  to 
McFarland stated:  "I  have some  important information I want to  share that I picked up  on my 
travels  over the  last month."946  Manafort told  the  Office  that the  email  referred  to  an  issue 
regarding Cuba,  not Russia or Ukraine,  and Manafort had traveled to Cuba in the past month.947 
Either way, McFarland- who  was  advised  by Flynn not to  respond to  the Manafort inquiry(cid:173)
appears not to have responded to Manafort. 948 

Manafort told the Office that around the time of the Presidential Inauguration in January, 
he  met  with  Kilimnik  and  Ukrainian  oligarch  Serhiy  Lyovochkin  at  the  Westin  Hotel  in 
Alexandria, Virginia.949  During this  meeting, Kilimnik again discussed the Y anukovych peace 
plan that he had broached at the August 2 meeting and in a detailed December 8,  2016 message 
found  in  Kilimnik' s  DMP  email  account.950

acknowledged having read,951  Kilimnik wrote, "[a]ll that is required to stait the process is a very 
minor 'wink' (or slight push) from DT"-an apparent reference to President-elect Trump-"and 
a decision to  authorize you to be a  'special representative'  and manage this process."  Kilimnik 
assured Manafort, with that authority, he "could start the process and within  10 days visit Russia 
[Y anukovych] guarantees your reception at the very top level," and that "DT could have peace in 
Ukraine basically within a few months after inauguration."952 

On February 26, 2017, Manafort met Kilimnik in Madrid, where Kilimnik had flown from 
Moscow.956  In his first two  interviews with the Office, Manafort denied meeting with Kilimnik 
on his Madrid trip and then-after being confronted with documentary evidence that Kilimnik was 
in Madrid at the same time as him-recognized that he met him  in  Madrid.  Manafort said that 
Kilimnik had updated him on a criminal investigation into so-called "black ledger" payments to 
Manafort  that  was  bein  conducted  b  Ukraine's  National  Anti-Corru  tion  Bureau.957 

Manafort remained in contact with Kilimnik throughout 2017 and into the spring of 2018.

U.S. Department of Justice 

Those contacts included matters pertaining to the criminal charges brought by the Office,959  and 
the Ukraine peace plan.  In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft 
poll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked 
with Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.960  The primer sent to the pollsters specifically 
called for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas 
with Yanukovych as Prime Minister,961  and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions 
on  Yanukovych' s  role  in  resolving  the  conflict  in  Donbas.962 
(The  poll was  not  solely  about 
Donbas; it also sought participants' views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to 
the 2019 Ukraine presidential election.) 

The Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to 
the attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration.  Kilimnik continued his efforts 
to promote the peace plan to the Executive Branch (e.g.,  U.S. Department of State) into the summer 
of 2018.963 

B.  Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts 

Trump  was  elected  President on November 8,  2016.  Beginning  immediately after the 
election,  individuals  connected  to  the  Russian  government  started  contacting  officials  on the 
Trump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels-sometimes through Russian 
Ambassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through 
U.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team.  The most senior levels of the 
Russian government encouraged these efforts.  The investigation did not establish that these efforts 
reflected  or constituted  coordination  between the  Trump  Campaign  and  Russia in  its election(cid:173)
interference activities. 

1.  Immediate Post-Election Activity 

As  soon  as  news  broke  that  Trump  had  been  elected  President,  Russian  government 
officials  and  prominent  Russian  businessmen  began  trying  to  make  inroads  into  the  new 
Administration.  They appeared  not to  have preexisting  contacts and struggled to  connect with 
senior officials around the President-Elect.  As explained below, those efforts entailed both official 
contact through the  Russian  Embassy in the United  States  and  outreaches-sanctioned at high 
levels of the Russian government-through business rather than political contacts.

a.  Outreach from the Russian Government 

At approximately 3 a.m.  on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks 
received a telephone call on her personal cell phone from a  person who sounded foreign but was 
calling from a number with a DC area code.964  Although Hicks had a hard time understanding the 
person, she could make out the words "Putin call."965  Hicks told the caller to send her an email.966 

The following morning, on November 9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian 
Embassy  to  the  United  States,  emailed  Hicks  from  his  Gmail  address  with  the  subject  line, 
"Message from Putin."967  Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and 
Russian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to convey to the President-Elect.968  In the message, Putin 
offered  his  congratulations  to  Trump  for  his  electoral  victory,  stating  he "look[ ed]  forward  to 
working with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis."969 

Hicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, "Can you look into this? Don't want to get 
duped  but don't want to blow off Putin!"97° Kushner stated in Congressional testimony that he 
believed that it would be possible to  verify the  authenticity of the forwarded email through the 
Russian Ambassador, whom Kushner had previously met in April 2016.971  Unable to recall the 
Russian  Ambassador's name, Kushner emailed Dimitri  Simes of CNI,  whom he  had  consulted 
previously about Russia, see Volume I,  Section IV.A.4, supra,  and asked, "What is  the name of 
Russian  ambassador?"972  Kushner forwarded  Simes's  response-which  identified  Kislyak  by 
name-to Hicks.973  After checking with Kushner to  see what he had  learned,  Hicks conveyed 
Putin's letter to transition officials.974  Five days later,  on November 14, 2016, Trump and Putin 
spoke  by  phone  in  the  presence  of Transition  Team  members,  including  incoming  National 
Security Advisor Michael Flynn.975

b.  High-Level Encouragement of Contacts through Alternative Channels 

As Russian officials in the United States reached out to the President-Elect and his team, a 
number  of Russian  individuals working  in  the  private  sector  began  their  own efforts  to  make 
contact.  Petr Aven, a Russian national who heads Alfa-Bank, Russia's largest commercial bank, 
described to the Office interactions with Putin during this time period that might account for the 
tlurry of Russian activity.976 

· 

Aven told the Office that he is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who 
regularly  meet with  Putin in  the Kremlin;  these  50  men are  often  referred  to  as "oligarchs."977 
Aven told the  Office that he met on a  quarterly basis  with  Putin,  including in the fourth quarter 
(Q4) of 2016, shortly after the U.S. presidential election.978  Aven said that he took these meetings 
seriously and understood that any suggestions or critiques that Putin made during these meetings 
were  implicit directives,  and  that  there  would  be  consequences for  A ven if he  did  not follow 
through.979  As was typical, the 2016 Q4 meeting with Putin was preceded by a preparatory meeting 
with Putin's chief of staff, Anton Vaino.980 

According  to  A ven,  at his  Q4  2016  one-on-one meeting  with  Putin,98 1  Putin  raised  the 
prospect that the United States would impose additional sanctions on Russian interests, including 
sanctions against Aven and/or Alfa-Bank.982  Putin suggested that Aven needed  to  take steps to 
protect himself and Alfa-Bank. 983  Aven also testified that Putin spoke of the difficulty faced  by 
the  Russian  government  in  getting  in  touch  with  the  incoming  Trump  Administration.984 
According  to  Aven,  Putin  indicated  that  he  did  not  know  with  whom  formally  to  speak  and 
generally did not know the people around the President-Elect.985

A ven referred to the high-ranking Russian government officials using numbers (e.g., Official 1, Official 2). 
Aven separately confirmed th.rough an attorney proffer that Official 1 was Putin and Official 2 was Putin's 
chiefofstaff, Vaino.  See Affidavit of Ryan Junck (Aug. 2, 2018) (hard copy on file). 

981  At the time of his Q4 2016 meeting with Putin, A ven was generally aware of the press coverage 
about Russian interference in the U.S. election.  According to Aven, he did not discuss that topic with Putin 
at any point, and Putin did not mention the rationale behind the threat of new sanctions.  Aven 8/2/18 302,

Aven 

told Putin he would take steps to protect himself and the Alfa-Bank 
shareholders from potential sanctions, and one of those steps would be to try to  reach out to the 
incoming  Administration  to  establish  a  line  of  communication.986  A ven  described  Putin 
responding with skepticism about Aven's prospect for success.987  According to  Aven,  although 
Putin did not expressly direct him to reach out to the Trump Transition Team, Aven understood 
that Putin expected him to  try to  respond to  the  concerns  he  had raised. 988  A ven' s  efforts  are 
described in Volume I, Section IV.B.5, infra. 

2.  Kirill Dmitriev's Transition-Era Outreach to the Incoming Administration 

Aven's description of his  interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill 
Dmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected 
to Putin.  Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in 
the months after the election.  Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United 
Arab Emirates (UAE) royal  court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials, 
and Nader eventually arranged a  meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a 
Trump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon.989  In addition, the UAE national 
security advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick 
Gerson,  in  late  November 2016.  In  December 2016 and  January  2017, Dmitriev  and  Gerson 
worked on a  proposal for  reconciliation  between the United States  and Russia,  which Dmitriev 
implied  he  cleared  through  Putin.  Gerson  provided  that  proposal  to  Kushner  before  the 
inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. 

a.  Background 

Dmitriev is a Russian national who was appointed CEO of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, 
the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), when it was founded  in 2011.990  Dmitriev reported 
directly to Putin and frequently referred to Putin as his "boss."991 

RDIF has co-invested in various projects with UAE sovereign wealth funds. 992  Dmitriev 
regularly  interacted with Nader, a  senior advisor to  UAE Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Zayed 

989  Nader  provided  information  to  the  Office  in  multi  le  interviews, all  but one of which  were 
conducted under a proffer agreement 
.  The 
investi  ators also interviewed Prince  under a proffer agreement.  Bannon was interviewed by the Office, 

under a proffer agreement.

(Crown Prince Mohammed), in connection with RDIF's dealings with the UAE.993  Putin wanted 
Dmitriev to be in charge of both the financial and the political relationship between Russia and the 
Gulf states, in part because Dmitriev had been educated in the West and spoke English fluently. 994 
Nader  considered  Dmitriev  to  be  Putin's  interlocutor  in  the  Gulf  region,  and  would  relay 
Dmitriev's views directly to Crown Prince Mohammed.995 

Nader developed contacts with both U.S. presidential campaigns during the 2016 election, 
and kept Dmitriev abreast of his efforts to do  so.996  According to Nader,  Dmitriev said that his 
and the government of Russia's preference was for candidate Trum  to win  and asked Nader to 
assist him  in  meetin  members  of the  Trum  Cam  ai  n.997

Later that morning, Dmitriev contacted Nader, who was in New York, to request a meeting 
with the "key people"  in the  incoming Administration as soon as possible in light of the "[g]reat 
results."1016  He  asked Nader to  convey to  the  incoming Administration that "we want to  start 
rebuilding the relationship in whatever is a comfortable pace for them.  We understand all of the 
sensitivities  and  are  not  in  a  rush." 1017  Dmitriev  and  Nader  had  previously  discussed  Nader 
introducing him to the contacts Nader had made within the Trump Campaign. 1018  Dmitriev also 
told Nader that he would ask Putin for permission to travel to the United States, where he would 
be able to speak to media outlets about the positive impact of Trump's election and the need for 
reconciliation between the United States and Russia. 101 9 

Later that day,  Dmitriev  flew  to  New  York,  where  Peskov  was  separately  traveling to 
attend the chess  tournament. 1020  Dmitriev  invited Nader to  the opening of the  tournament and 
noted that, if there was "a chance to see anyone key from Trump camp," he "would love to start 
building for the future.'' 1021  Dmitriev also asked Nader to invite Kushner to the event so that he 
(Dmitriev)  could  meet  him. 1022  Nader  did  not  pass  along  Dmitriev's  invitation  to  anyone 
connected with the incoming Administration. 1023  Although one World Chess Federation official 
recalled hearing from an attendee that President-Elect Trump had stopped by the tournament, the 
investigation did not establish that Trump or any Campaign or Transition Team official attended 
the event. 1024  And the President's written answers denied that he had. 1025 

Nader stated  that Dmitriev  continued  to  press him  to  set  up  a  meeting  with  transition 
officials, and was  particularly focused  on Kushner and  Trump Jr. 1026  Dmitriev told Nader that

According to Nader, Dmitriev was very 
anxious to connect with the incoming Administration and told Nader that he would try other routes 
to  do  so  besides  Nader  himself. 1030  Nader  did  not  ultimately  introduce  Dmitriev  to  anyone 
associated with the incoming Administration during Dmitriev' s post-election trip to New York. 103 1 

In  early  December  2016,  Dmitriev  again  broached  the  topic  of meeting  incoming 
Administration  officials  with  Nader in  January  or February. 1032  Dmitriev  sent Nader  a  list of 
publicly  available  quotes  of Dmitriev  speaking  positively  about Donald  Trump  "in  case they

to meet you!  I know him and he is very very well connected and trusted by the New Team.  His 
sister is now a Minister of Education."1055  According to Nader, Prince had led him to believe that 
Bannon was aware of Prince's upcoming meeting with Dmitriev, and Prince acknowledged that it 
was  fair  for Nader to think that  Prince would  pass  information on to the Transition  Team. 1056

Dmitriev arrived with his wife in the Seychelles on January 11, 2017, and checked into the 
Four Seasons Resort where Crown Prince Mohammed and Nader were staying. 1058  Prince arrived 
that same day. 1059  Prince and Dmitriev met for the first time that afternoon in Nader's villa, with 
Nader present. 1060  The initial meeting lasted approximately 30-45 minutes. 1061 

Prince described  the  eight 
years of the Obama Administration in negative terms, and stated that he was looking forward to a 
new era of cooperation  and  conflict resolution. 1063  According to  Prince, he told  Dmitriev that 
Bannon was effective if not conventional, and that Prince provided policy papers to Bannon. 1064

topic of Russian interference in the 2016 election did not come up. 

Prince added that he would inform Bannon about his meeting with Dmitriev, and that if there was 
interest in continuin  the discussion, Bannon or someone else on the Transition Team would do 
so.1011 

Afterwards, Prince returned to  his  room, where he learned that a Russian aircraft carrier 
had  sailed to  Libya,  which  led him  to  call Nader and  ask him to  set up another meeting with 
Dmitriev. 1073  According to Nader, Prince called and said he had checked with his associates back 
home  and  needed  to  convey  to  Dmitriev  that  Libya  was  "off the  table."1074  Nader  wrote  to 
Dmitriev that Prince had "received an urgent message that he needs to convey to you immediately," 
and  arranged  for  himself,  Dmitriev,  and  Prince  to  meet  at a  restaurant  on  the  Four  Seasons 
property. 101s 

At the second meeting, Prince told Dmitriev that the United States could not acce

After  the  brief  second  meeting  concluded,  Nader  and  Dmitriev  discussed  what  had 
transpired. 1078  Dmitriev told Nader that he was disappointed in his meetings with Prince for two 
reasons:  first, he believed the Russians needed to be communicating with someone who had more 
authority within the incoming Administration than Prince had. 1079  Second, he had hoped to have 
a  discussion  of greater  substance,  such  as  outlinin  a  strate  ic  roadmap  for  both  countries to

After the Seychelles meetings, Prince told Nader that he would inform Bannon about his 
discussion with Dmitriev and would convey that someone within the Russian power structure was 
interested in seeking better relations with the incoming Administration. 1083  On January 12, 2017, 
Prince  contacted  Bannon's  personal  assistant  to  set up  a  meeting  for  the  following  week. 1084 
Several days later, Prince messaged her again asking about Bannon' s schedule. 1085 

Prince said that he met Bannon at Bannon's home after returning to the United States in 
mid-January and briefed him about several topics, including his meeting with Dmitriev .1086  Prince 
told the Office that he explained to Bannon that Dmitriev was the head of a  Russian sovereign 
wealth fund and was interested in  improving relations between the  United States and Russia. 1087 
Prince  had on his cellphone a screenshot ofDmitriev's Wikipedia page dated January 16, 2017,

and Prince told the Office that he likely showed that image to Bannon. 1088  Prince also believed he 
provided Bannon with Dmitriev's contact information. 1089  According to Prince, Bannon instructed 
Prince not to  follow  up  with Dmitriev,  and Prince  had the  impression that the  issue  was  not a 
priority  for  Bannon.1090  Prince  related  that  Bannon  did  not  appear  angry,  just  relatively 
uninterested. 1091 

Bannon, by contrast, told the Office that he never discussed with Prince anything regarding 
Dmitriev, RDIF,  or any  meetings  with Russian individuals  or people associated  with Putin. 1092 
Bannon also stated that had Prince mentioned such a meeting, Bannon would have remembered it, 
and Bannon would have objected to such a meeting having taken place. 1093 

The  conflicting  accounts  provided  by  Bannon  and  Prince  could  not  be  independently 
clarified by reviewing their communications, because neither one was able to produce any of the 
messages they exchanged in the time period surrounding the Seychelles meeting.  Prince's phone 
contained  no text messages  prior to March  2017,  though provider records  indicate that he  and 
Bannon exchanged dozens of messages.1094  Prince denied deleting any messages but claimed he 
did not know why there were no messages on his device before March 2017. 1095  Bannon's devices 
similarly contained no messages  in  the  relevant time period, and Bannon also stated he did not 
know why messages did not appear on his device. 1096  Bannon told the Office that, during both the 
months  before  and after the Seychelles meeting, he regularly used his  personal Blackberry and 
personal email  for  work-related communications (including those with Prince),  and he took no 
steps to preserve these work communications.1097

Dmitriev's contacts  during the transition  period were  not limited to  those facilitated  by 
Nader.  In  approximately  late  November 2016,  the  UAE  national  security  advisor  introduced 
Dmitriev to  Rick Gerson,  a  friend  of Jared Kushner who  runs  a  hedge  fund  in New  York. 1098 
Gerson  stated  he  had  no  formal  role  in  the  transition  and  had  no  involvement  in  the  Trump

Campaign other than occasional casual discussions about the Campaign with Kushner. 1099  After 
the  election,  Gerson  assisted  the  transition  by  arranging  meetings  for  transition  officials  with 
former UK prime minister Tony Blair and a UAE delegation led by Crown Prince Mohammed. 1100 

When  Dmitriev  and  Gerson  met,  they  principally  discussed  potential  joint  ventures 
between  Gerson's  hedge  fund  and  RDIF. 1101  Dmitriev  was  interested  in  improved  economic 
cooperation between the United States and Russia and asked Gerson who he should meet with in 
the incoming Administration who would be helpful towards this goal. 1102  Gerson replied that he 
would  try  to  figure  out  the  best  way  to  arrange  appropriate  introductions,  but  noted  that 
confidentiality would be required because of the sensitivity of holding such meetings before the 
new  Administration  took  power,  and  before  Cabinet  nominees  had  been  confirmed  by  the 
Senate. 1103  Gerson said he would ask Kushner and Michael Flynn who the "key person or people" 
were on the topics of reconciliation with Russia, joint security concerns, and economic matters. 1104 

Dmitriev  told  Gerson  that  he  had  been  tasked  by  Putin  to  develop  and  execute  a 
reconciliation plan between the United States and Russia. He noted in a text message to  Gerson 
that if Russia was "approached with respect and willingness to understand our position, we can 
have Major Breakthroughs quickly."1105  Gerson and Dmitriev exchanged ideas in December 2016 
about what such a reconciliation plan would include. 1106  Gerson told the Office that the Transition 
Team had not asked him to engage in these discussions with Dmitriev, and that he did so on his 
own initiative and as a private citizen.1107 

On January  9,  2017,  the  same  day  he  asked  Nader  whether  meeting  Prince  would  be 
worthwhile, Dmitriev sent his biography to Gerson and asked him if he could "share it with Jared 
( or somebody else very senior in the team) - so that they know that we are focused from our side 
on improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that."1108  Dmitriev also 
asked Gerson if he knew Prince, and  if Prince was somebody important or worth spending time

with.1109  After his trip to the Seychelles, Dmitriev told Gerson that Bannon had asked Prince to 
meet with Dmitriev and that the two had had a positive meeting. 1110 

On January  16, 2017, Dmitriev consolidated the ideas for  U.S.-Russia reconciliation that 
(1) 
he and Gerson had been discussing into  a two-page document that listed five  main  points: 
jointly fighting terrorism;  (2) jointly engaging  in anti-weapons of mass  destruction efforts; (3) 
developing "win-win" economic and investment initiatives; (4) maintaining an honest, open, and 
continual dialogue regarding issues of disagreement; and (5) ensuring proper communication and 
trust by  "key people"  from each country. 1111  On January  18, 2017, Gerson  gave  a copy of the 
document to Kushner. 1112  Kushner had not heard of Dmitriev at that time. 1113  Gerson explained 
that  Dmitriev  was  the  head  of RDIF,  and  Gerson  may  have  alluded  to  Dmitriev' s  being well 
connected. 1114  Kushner  placed  the  document  in  a  file  and  said  he  would  get  it  to  the  right 
people. 1115  Kushner  ultimately  gave one copy  of the document to  Bannon and  another to Rex 
Tillerson;  according  to Kushner,  neither  of them  followed  up  with  Kushner  about  it. 1116  On 
January 19, 2017, Dmitriev sent Nader a copy of the two-page document, telling him that this was 
"a view from  our side that I discussed  in my meeting on the  islands and with you and with our 
friends. Please share with them - we believe this is a good foundation to start from." 1117 

Gerson informed Dmitriev that he had given the document to Kushner soon after delivering 
it. 1118  On January 26, 2017, Dmitriev wrote to Gerson that his "boss"-an apparent reference to 
Putin-was asking if there had been any feedback on the proposal. 1119  Dmitriev said, " [w]e do 
not want to rush things and move at a comfortable speed.  At the same time, my boss asked me to 
try to have the key US meetings in the next two weeks if possible."1120  He informed Gerson that 
Putin and President Trump would speak by phone that Saturday, and noted that that information 
was "very confidential."1121 

The same day, Dmitriev wrote to Nader that he  had seen his "boss"  again yesterday who 
had "emphasized that this is a great priority for us and that we need to build this communication

channel to avoid  bureaucracy." 1122  On January 28,  2017, Dmitriev texted Nader that he wanted 
"to see if I can confirm to my boss that your friends may use some of the ideas from the 2 pager I 
sent you  in the telephone call that will  happen  at 12  EST,"1123  an apparent reference to the call 
scheduled between President Trump and Putin.  Nader replied,  "Definitely paper was so submitted 
to Team by Rick and me. They took it seriously!"1124  After the call between President Trump and 
Putin  occurred,  Dmitriev  wrote to  Nader that "the  call  went very  well.  My  boss  wants  me to 
continue  making  some  public  statements  that  us  [sic]  Russia  cooperation  is  good  and 
important." 1125  Gerson also wrote to  Dmitriev to say that the call  had  gone well, and Dmitriev 
replied that the document they had drafted together "played an important role." 1126 

Gerson and Dmitriev appeared to stop communicating with one another in approximately 
March 2017, when the investment deal  they had been working on together showed no  signs  of 
progressing.1127 

3.  Ambassador  Kislyak's  Meeting  with  Jared  Kushner  and  Michael  Flynn  m 

Trump Tower Following the Election 

On November 16,  2016, Catherine Vargas,  an executive assistant to  Kushner, received a 
request for a meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. 1128  That same day, Vargas sent 
Kushner  an  email  with  the  subject,  "MISSED  CALL:  Russian  Ambassador to  the  US,  Sergey 
Ivanovich Kislyak .... " 1129  The text of the email read, "RE: setting up a time to meet w/you on 
12/1.  LMK how to proceed."  Kushner responded in relevant part, "I think I do this one -- confirm 
with  Dimitri [Simes of CNI] that this  is the right guy ." 1130  After reaching out to a colleague of 
Simes at CNI, Vargas reported back to Kushner that Kislyak was "the best go-to guy for routine 
matters  in the US," while Yuri Ushakov,  a Russian foreign policy  advisor,  was  the contact for 
"more direct/substantial matters." 11 31 

Bob Foresman, the UBS investment bank executive who had previously tried to transmit 
to candidate Trump an invitation to speak at an economic forum in Russia, see Volume I, Section 
IV.A.l.d.ii, supra, may have provided similar information to the Transition Team.  According to

Foresman, at the end of an early December 2016 meeting with incoming National Security Advisor 
Michael Flynn and his designated deputy (K.T. McFarland) in New York, Flynn asked Foresman 
for his thoughts on Kislyak.  Foresman had not met Kislyak but told Flynn that, while Kislyak was 
an  important person,  Kislyak  did  not  have  a  direct  line to  Putin. 1132  Foresman  subsequently 
traveled to Moscow, inquired of a  source he believed to be close to Putin, and  heard back from 
that source that Ushakov would be the  official  channel  for the  incoming U.S.  national security 
advisor. 1133  Foresman acknowledged that Flynn had not asked him to undertake that inquiry in 
Russia but told the Office that he nonetheless felt obligated to report the information back to Flynn, 
and that he worked to get a face-to-face meeting with Flynn in January 2017 so that he could do 
so.1134  Email correspondence suggests that the meeting ultimately went forward, 1135 but Flynn has 
no  recollection of it or of the earlier December meeting.1136  (The investigation did not identify 
evidence of Flynn or Kushner meeting with Ushakov after being given his name. 1137
) 

In  the meantime,  although he  had  already  formed  the  impression  that Kislyak was  not 
necessarily the right point of contact, 1138 Kushner went forward with the meeting that Kislyak had 
It  took  place  at  Trump  Tower  on  November  30,  2016. 1139  At 
requested  on  November  16. 
Kushner' s invitation, Flynn also attended;  Bannon was invited but did not attend.1140  During the 
meeting,  which lasted approximately 30 minutes, Kushner expressed a  desire on the part of the 
incoming  Administration  to  start  afresh  with  U.S.-Russian  relations. 1141  Kushner  also  asked 
Kislyak to identify the best person (whether Kislyak or someone else) with whom to direct future 
discussions-someone who had contact with Putin and the ability to speak for him. 1142 

The three men also discussed U.S.  policy toward Syria, and Kislyak floated  the idea of 
having Russian generals  brief the Transition Team on the topic using a  secure communications 
line. 1143  After Flynn  explained  that there was  no  secure  line  in  the  Transition  Team  offices,

Kushner  asked  Kislyak  if  they  could  communicate  using  secure  facilities  at  the  Russian 
Embassy. 1144  Kislyak quickly rejected that idea. 1145 

4.  Jared Kushner's Meeting with Sergey Gorkov 

On December 6, 2016, the Russian Embassy reached out to Kushner's assistant to set up a 
second meeting  between Kislyak and Kushner. 1146  Kushner declined several proposed meeting 
dates,  but Kushner's assistant indicated that Kislyak was very insistent about securing a  second 
meeting. 1147  Kushner told the Office that he did not want to take another meeting because he had 
already decided  Kislyak was  not the  right channel  for  him to communicate with  Russia,  so  he 
arranged to have one of his assistants, A vi Berkowitz, meet with Kislyak in his stead. 1148  Although 
embassy  official  Sergey  Kuznetsov  wrote  to  Berkowitz that Kislyak  thought it "important"  to 
"continue the conversation with Mr. Kushner in  person,"1149  Kislyak nonetheless agreed to meet 
· instead with Berkowitz once it became apparent that Kushner was unlikely to take a meeting. 

Berkowitz met with Kislyak on  December 12, 2016,  at Trump Tower. 1150  The  meeting 
lasted  only  a  few  minutes,  during  which  Kislyak  indicated  that  he  wanted  Kushner  to  meet 
someone who  had  a  direct  line  to  Putin:  Sergey  Gorkov,  the  head of the  Russian-government(cid:173)
owned bank Vnesheconombank (VEB). 

Kushner agreed to meet with Gorkov. 1151  The one-on-one meeting took place the next day, 
December 13, 2016, at the Colony Capital building in Manhattan, where Kushner had previously 
scheduled  meetings. 1152  VEB  was  (and  is)  the  subject  of Department  of Treasury  economic 
sanctions imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. 1153  Kushner did not, however, 
recall any discussion during his meeting with Gorkov about the sanctions against VEB or sanctions 
more generally. 1154  Kushner stated in an interview that he did not engage in any preparation for

the  meeting  and  that  no  one  on  the  Transition  Team  even  did  a  Google  search  for 
Gorkov's name. 1155 

At the start of the meeting, Gorkov presented Kushner with two gifts: a painting and a bag 

of soil from the town in Belarus where Kushner's family originated. 1156 

The accounts from Kushner and Gorkov differ as to whether the meeting was diplomatic 
or business  in  nature.  Kushner told  the  Office that the  meeting was  diplomatic,  with  Gorkov 
expressing  disappointment  with  U.S.-Russia  relations  under  President  Obama  and  hopes  for 
improved relations with the incoming Administration. 11 57  According to Kushner, although Gorkov 
told Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the 
two did not discuss Kushner's companies or private business dealings of any kind. 1158  (At the time 
of the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at

property  and possible  conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his  company's  borrowing 
from foreign lenders. 1159

) 

In contrast,  in  a  2017  public  statement,  VEB  suggested  Gorkov  met with  Kushner  in 
Kushner' s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather 
than  as  part of a  diplomatic  effort. 
In  particular,  VEB  characterized  Gorkov's  meeting  with 
Kushner as part of a series of "roadshow meetings" with "representatives of major US banks and 
business circles," which included "negotiations" and discussion of the "most promising business 
lines and sectors." 1160 

Foresman, the  investment bank executive mentioned in Volume  l,  Sections IV.A. I  and 
IV.B.3,  supra,  told  the  Office  that  he  met  with  Gorkov  and  VEB  deputy  chairman  Nikolay 
Tsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkov left for New York to meet Kushner. 1161  According to 
Foresman, Gorkov and Tsekhomsky told him that they were traveling to New York to discuss post(cid:173)
election issues with U.S. financial institutions, that their trip was sanctioned by Putin, and that they 
would be reporting back to Putin upon their return. 1162 

1155  Kushner 4/11/18 302, at  19.  Berkowitz, by  contrast, stated to the  Office that he  had googled

The  investigation did  not resolve  the apparent conflict in the  accounts  of Kushner and 
Gorkov or determine whether the meeting was diplomatic in nature (as Kushner stated), focused 
on business (as VEB ' s  public statement indicated), or whether it involved  some combination of 
those matters or other matters.  Regardless, the investigation did not identify evidence that Kushner 
and Gorkov engaged in any substantive follow-up after the meeting. 

Rather,  a  few days after the meeting, Gorkov's assistant texted Kushner' s assistant, "Hi, 
please inform your side that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!"' 163 
Over the following weeks, the two assistants exchanged a handful of additional cordial texts. 1164 
On February 8, 2017,  Gorkov's  assistant texted Kushner' s assistant (Berkowitz) to try to set up 
another meeting, and followed up by text at least twice in the days that followed. 1165  According 
to  Berkowitz, he did not respond to the meeting request in light of the press coverage regarding 
the Russia investigation, and did not tell Kushner about the meeting request. 1166 

5.  Petr Aven's Outreach Efforts to the Transition Team 

In December 2016, weeks after the one-on-one meeting with Putin described in Volume I, 
Section IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate "all-hands" oligarch 
meeting between Putin and Russia's most prominent businessmen. 1167  As in Aven's one-on-one 
meeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 was the prospect of 
forthcoming U.S. economic sanctions. 1168 

After the December 2016 all-hands meeting, A ven tried to establish a  connection to the 
Trump  team.  A ven  instructed  Richard  Burt  to  make  contact  with  the  incoming  Trump 
Administration.  Burt was on the board of directors for LetterOne (L 1 ), another company headed 
by  Aven, and had done work for Alfa-Bank. 1169  Burt had previously served as U .S. ambassador 
to Germany and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and one of his 
primary roles  with Alfa-Bank and Ll was to facilitate  introductions  to  business contacts  in the 
United States and other Western countries. 1170 

While at a Ll board meeting held in Luxembourg in late December 2016, Aven pulled Burt 
aside and told him that he had spoken to someone high in the Russian government who expressed

interest in establishing a communications channel between the Kremlin and the Trump Transition 
Team. 1171  Aven asked for Burt's help in contacting members of the Transition Team. 1172  Although 
Burt had been  responsible  for  helping Aven build connections in the past,  Burt viewed Aven's 
request as unusual and outside the normal realm of his dealings with Aven. 1173 

Burt,  who  is  a  member  of the  board  of CNI  (discussed  at  Volume  I,  Section  IV.A.4, 
supra), 1174  decided to approach CNI president Dimitri Simes for help facilitating A ven' s request, 
recalling that Simes had some relationship with Kushner. 1175  At the time, Simes was lobbying the 
Trump Transition Team, on Burt's behalf, to appoint Burt U.S. ambassador to Russia.1176 

Burt contacted Simes by telephone and asked if he could arrange a meeting with Kushner 
to  discuss  setting  up  a  high-level  communications  channel  between  Putin  and  the  incoming 
Administration. 1177  Simes told the Office that he declined and stated to Burt that setting up such 
a channel was not a good idea in light of the media attention surrounding Russian influence in the 
U.S. presidential election. 1178  According to Simes, he understood that Burt was seeking a secret 
channel,  and  Simes  did  not  want  CNI  to  be  seen  as  an  intermediary  between  the  Russian 
government and the incoming Administration. 1179  Based on what Simes had read in the media, he 
stated  that  he  already  had  concerns  that Trump's  business  connections  could  be exploited  by 
Russia, and Simes said that he did not want CNI to have any involvement or apparent involvement 
in facilitating any connection. 1180 

In  an  email  dated  December 22,  2016,  Burt recounted  for  Aven  his  conversation with 

Simes: 

Through a trusted third party, I have reached out to the very influential person I mentioned 
in  Luxembourg concerning Project A.  There  is an interest and an understanding for the 
need to establish such a channel.  But the individual emphasized that at this moment, with 
so much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking 
(and who ordered what), Project A was too explosive to discuss.  The individual agreed to 
discuss it again after the New Year.  I trust the individual 's instincts on this.

If this is unclear or you would like to discuss, don't hesitate to call. 1181 

According  to  Burt,  the  "very  influential  person"  referenced  in  his  email  was  Simes,  and  the 
reference to a "trusted third party" was a fabrication, as no such third party existed.  "Project A" 
was a term that Bmt created for Aven's effort to help establish a communications channel between 
Russia and the Trump team, which he used in light of the sensitivities surrounding what A ven was 
requesting, especially in light of the recent attention to Russia' s influence in the U.S. presidential 
election. 1182  According to Burt, his report that there was " interest"  in a communications channel 
reflected  Simes's views,  not necessarily  those  of the  Transition Team,  and  in  any event,  Burt 
acknowledged that he added some "hype" to that sentence to make it sound like there was more 
interest from the Transition Team than may have actually existed. 1183 

Aven  replied  to  Burt' s  email  on  the  same  day,  saying  "Thank  you.  All  clear." 1184 
According to Aven, this statement indicated that he did not want the outreach to continue. 1185  Burt 
spoke to  A ven  some  time  thereafter  about his  attempt to  make  contact with the  Trum 
team, 
~ h a t  the current environment made it impossible, 
_ ___  11 86  Burt did not recall discussing Aven's request with Simes again, nor did 
he recall speaking to anyone else about the request. 1187 

In the first quarter of 2017, A ven met again with Putin and other Russian officials. 1188  At 
that meeting, Putin asked about Aven' s attem  t to build relations with the Trum  Administration 
and A ven recounted his lack of success. 1189

7.  Contacts With and Through Michael T. Flynn 

Incoming National  Security  Advisor Michael Flynn was the  Transition Team' s primary 
conduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive 
matters  during  the transition period:  a  United  Nations  Security  Council  vote  and  the  Russian 
government' s reaction to the United States' s  imposition of sanctions for Russian interference  in 
the 2016 election.1207  Despite Kushner' s conclusion that Kislyak did  not wield influence  inside 
the  Russian  government,  the  Transition  Team  turned  to  Flynn's  relationship  with  Kislyak  on 
both issues.  As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy, 
to  prepare  for  his  call  to  Kislyak;  McFarland  was  with  the  President-Elect  and  other  senior 
members of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time.  Although transition officials at Mar(cid:173)
a-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did 
not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak.  Flynn 
asked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29, 
2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request. 

a.  United Nations Vote on Israeli Settlements 

On  December  21,  2016,  Egypt  submitted  a  resolution to  the  United Nations  Security 
Council calling on Israel to cease settlement activities  in Palestinian territory'. 1208  The Security 
Council, which includes Russia,  was scheduled to  vote on the resolution the  following  day.1209 
There  was  speculation  in  the  media  that  the  Obama  Administration  would  not  oppose  the 
resolution. 1210 

1204 

1205 

1206 

1207  As discussed further in Volume I,  Section V.C.4,  infra, Flynn pleaded guilty to  making false 
statements to the  FBI,  in violation of 18  U.S.C.  § 1001,  about these communications with Ambassador

According  to  Flynn,  the  Transition  Team  regarded  the  vote  as  a  significant  issue  and 
wanted to support Israel by opposing the resolution. 1211  On December 22, 2016, multiple members 
of the Transition Team, as well as President-Elect Trump, communicated with foreign government 
officials to determine their views on the resolution and to rally support to delay the vote or defeat 
the resolution. 1212  Kushner led the effort for the Transition Team; Flynn was responsible for the 
Russian government. 1213  Minutes after an early morning phone call with Kushner on December 
22, Flynn called Kislyak. 1214  According to Flynn,  he informed Kislyak about the vote and the 
Transition Team's opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the 
resolution. 1215  Later that day, President-Elect Trump spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah 
al-Sisi about the vote. 1216  Ultimately, Egypt postponed the vote.1217 

On December 23, 2016, Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal, and Venezuela resubmitted the 
resolution. 1218  Throughout the day, members of the Transition Team continued to talk with foreign 
leaders  about  the  resolution,  with  Flynn  continuing  to  lead  the  outreach  with  the  Russian 
government through Kislyak. 1219  When Flynn again spoke with Kislyak, Kislyak informed Flynn 
that if the resolution  came to a  vote, Russia would  not vote against  it. 1220  The resolution  later 
passed 14-0, with the United States abstaining. 1221 

b.  U.S.  Sanctions Against Russia 

Flynn was also the Transition Team member who spoke with the Russian government when 
the  Obama Administration imposed sanctions and other measures against Russia in response to 
Russia's  interference in the 2016  presidential election.  On December 28,  2016,  then-President 
Obama signed Executive  Order  13757,  which took effect at 12:01  a.m.  the following  day  and

imposed sanctions on nine Russian individuals and entities. 1222 On December 29, 2016, the Obama 
Administration  also  expelled  35  Russian  government  officials  and  closed  two  Russian 
government-owned compounds in the United States. 1223 

During the rollout of the sanctions, President-Elect Trump and multiple Transition Team 

senior officials, including McFarland, Steve Bannon, and Reince Priebus, were staying at the Mar(cid:173)
a-Lago club in  Palm Beach, Florida.  Flynn was on vacation in the Dominican Republic, 1224  but 
was in daily contact with McFarland. 1225 

The  Transition  Team  and  President-Elect  Trump  were  concerned  that  these  sanctions 
would harm the United States's relationship with Russia. 1226  Although the details and timing of 
sanctions  were  unknown  on  December  28,  2016,  the  media  began  reporting  that  retaliatory 
measures from the Obama Administration against Russia were forthcoming. 1227 When asked about 
imposing  sanctions  on  Russia  for  its  alleged  interference  in  the  2016  presidential  election, 
President-Elect Trump told the media, "I think we ought to get on with our lives." 1228 

Russia initiated the outreach to  the Transition  Team.  On the evening of December 28, 
2016, Kislyak texted Flynn, "can you kindly call me back at your convenience."1229  Flynn did not 
respond to the text message that evening.  Someone from the Russian Embassy also called Flynn 
the next morning, at 10:38 a.m., but they did not talk. 1230 

The sanctions were announced publicly on December 29, 2016. 1231  At 1 :53 p.m. that day, 
McFarland began exchanging emails with multiple Transition Team members and advisors about 
the impact the sanctions would have on the incoming Administration. 1232 At 2:07 p.m., a Transition 
Team member texted Flynn a  link to a New York Times article about the sanctions. 1233  At 2:29

p.m., McFarland called Flynn, but they did not talk. 1234  Shortly thereafter, McFarland and Bannon 
discussed the sanctions. 1235  According to McFarland, Bannon remarked that the sanctions would 
hurt their ability to have good relations with Russia, and that Russian escalation would make things 
more difficult. 1236  McFarland believed she told Bannon that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak 
later that night. 1237  McFarland also believed she may have discussed the sanctions with Priebus, 
and  likewise told  him that Flynn was scheduled to talk to  Kislyak that night. 1238  At 3: 14  p.m., 
Flynn texted a  Transition Team member who was assisting McFarland, "Time for a  call???"1239

Flynn recalled that he chose not to communicate with Kislyak about the sanctions until he 
had heard from the team at Mar-a-Lago.1241  He first spoke with Michael Ledeen, 1242 a Transition 
Team member who advised on foreign  policy and national  security matters, for 20 minutes. 1243 
Flynn  then  spoke  with  McFarland  for  almost  20  minutes  to  discuss  what,  if anything,  to 
communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions. 1244  On that call, McFarland and Flynn discussed the 
sanctions, including their potential impact on the incoming Trump Administration's foreign policy 
goals. 1245  McFarland and Flynn also discussed that Transition Team members in Mar-a-Lago did 
not want Russia to  escalate the  situation. 1246  They  both  understood that Flynn  would relay  a 
message to Kislyak in hopes of making sure the situation would not get out of hand.1247

Immediately  after  speaking  with  McFarland,  Flynn  called  and  spoke  with  Kislyak. 1248 
Flynn  discussed  multiple  topics  with  Kislyak,  including  the  sanctions,  scheduling  a  video 
teleconference between President-Elect Trump and Putin, an upcoming terrorism conference, and 
Russia's  views about  the  Middle  East. 1249  With respect to  the  sanctions,  Flynn  requested  that 
Russia not escalate the situation, not get into a "tit for tat," and only respond to the sanctions in a 
reciprocal manner.1250 

Multiple Transition Team members were aware that Flynn was speaking with Kislyak that 
day.  In addition to  her conversations with Bannon and Reince Priebus, at 4:43  p.m., McFarland 
sent an email to  Transition Team members  about the sanctions,  informing the group that "Gen 
[F]lynn is  talking to  russian ambassador this evening." 1251  Less  than an hour later,  McFarland 
briefed President-Elect Trump. Bannon, Priebus, Sean Spicer, and other Transition Team members 
were present. 1252  During the briefing, President-Elect Trump asked McFarland if the Russians did 
"it," meaning the intrusions  intended  to  influence the  presidential election. 1253  McFarland  said 
yes,  and  President-Elect  Trump  expressed  doubt that  it  was the Russians.1254  McFarland  also 
discussed potential Russian responses to the sanctions, and said  Russia's response  would be an 
indicator of what the Russians wanted going forward. 1255  President-Elect Trump opined that the 
sanctions provided him with leverage to use with the Russians. 1256  McFarland recalled that at the 
end  of the  meeting,  someone  may  have  mentioned  to  President-Elect  Trump  that Flynn  was 
speaking to the Russian ambassador that evening. 1257 

After the briefing, Flynn and McFarland spoke over the phone. 1258  Flynn reported on the 
substance of his call with Kislyak,  including their discussion of the sanctions. 1259  According to 
McFarland,  Flynn  mentioned  that the  Russian  response  to  the  sanctions  was  not  going  to  be 
escalatory  because  they  wanted  a  good  relationship  with  the  incoming  Administration.1260 
McFarland also gave Flynn a summary of her recent briefing with President-Elect Trump. 1261

The next day, December 30, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that 
Russia would respond in kind to the sanctions. 1262  Putin superseded that comment two hours later, 
releasing a statement that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions 
at  that  time. 1263  Hours  later  President-Elect  Trump  tweeted,  "Great  move  on  delay  (by  V. 
Putin)." 1264  Shortly thereafter, Flynn sent a text message to McFarland summarizing his call with 
Kislyak from the day before, which she emailed to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other Transition 
Team members. 1265  The text message  and email  did  not include  sanctions as one of the topics 
discussed  with  Kislyak. 1266  Flynn told the  Office  that he did  not  document  his  discussion  of 
sanctions  because  it could  be  perceived as  getting  in  the  way  of the  Obama Administration's 
foreign policy.1267 

On December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received 
at the highest levels and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate to the sanctions in response to the 
request. 1268  Two  hours  later,  Flynn  spoke  with  McFarland  and  relayed  his  conversation with 
Kislyak. 1269  According  to  McFarland,  Flynn  remarked  that  the  Russians  wanted  a  better 
relationship  and that the relationship was  back on track. 127° Flynn also  told McFarland that he 
believed  his phone call had made  a  difference. 1271  McFarland recalled  congratulating Flynn  in 
response. 1272  Flynn  spoke  with  other  Transition  Team members  that  day,  but  does  not recall 
whether they discussed the sanctions. 1273  Flynn recalled discussing the sanctions with Bannon the 
next day and that Bannon appeared to know about Flynn's conversation with Kislyak. 1274  Bannon,

In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and 
individuals tied to the  Russian government.  Those links included Russian offers of assistance to 
the Campaign.  In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances 
the  Campaign  officials  shied  away.  Ultimately,  the  investigation  did  not  establish  that  the 
Campaign  coordinated  or  conspired  with  the  Russian  government  in  its  election-interference 
activities.

V.  PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS 

The  Appointment  Order  authorized  the  Special  Counsel's  Office  "to  prosecute federal 
crimes  arising  from  [its]  investigation"  of the  matters  assigned  to  it.  In deciding  whether to 
exercise  this  prosecutorial  authority,  the  Office  has  been  guided  by  the  Principles  of Federal 
Prosecution set forth  in the Justice (formerly U.S.  Attorney's) Manual.  In particular, the  Office 
has  evaluated  whether the  conduct  of the  individuals  considered  for  prosecution  constituted  a 
federal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain 
a conviction for such an offense.  Justice Manual § 9-27.220 (2018).  Where the answer to those 
questions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial 
federal  interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and 
there existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.  Id. 

As explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of 
Russian  nationals for their roles  in  er  etratin  the active-measures social media cam  ai  n and 

similarly determined that the contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals 
either  did  not  involve  the  commission  of a  federal  crime  or,  in  the  case  of campaign-finance 
offenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction.  At the 
same time,  the Office  concluded that  the  Principles  of Federal  Prosecution supported  charging 
certain  individuals  connected  to  the  Campaign  with  making  false  statements  or  otherwise 
obstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations. 

A.  Russian "Active Measures" Social Media Campaign 

On  February  16,  2018,  a  federal  grand  jury  in  the  District  of Columbia  returned  an 
indictment  charging  13  Russian  nationals  and  three  Russian  entities-including  the  Internet 
Research  Agency  (IRA)  and  Concord  Management  and  Consulting  LLC  (Concord)- with 
violating U.S.  criminal laws  in order to  interfere with U.S.  elections and political processes.1276 
The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count 
One), three defendants  with conspiracy to commit wire fraud  and •bank fraud  (Count Two), and 
five  defendants with  aggravated  identity theft (Counts Three through Eight).  Internet Research 
Agency Indictment.  Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, 
entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds. 
In  orders and memorandum opinions issued on  August 13  and November  15,  2018,  the district 
court denied Concord's motions to dismiss.  United States v.  Concord Management & Consulting 
LLC,  347  F.  Supp.  3d 38  (D.D.C.  2018).  United States v. Concord Management &  Consulting 
LLC, 317 F.  Supp. 3d 598 (D.D.C. 2018). As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains 
ongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The other defendants remain 
at large. 

12 76  A  more  detailed  explanation of the charging decision in this  case  is  set  forth  in  a  separate 

memorandum provided to the Acting Attorney General before the indictment.

U.S. Department of Justice 

Although members  of the  IRA  had  contact  with  individuals  affiliated  with  the  Trump 
Campaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person 
with  participating in the  conspiracy.  That is because the investigation did not identify evidence 
that any U.S.  person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was 
speaking  with  Russian  nationals  engaged  in  the  criminal  conspiracy.  The  Office  therefore 
determined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge 
them in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging 
a wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count 
Two). 

The Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen 
bank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S.  online payment systems 
by circumventing those systems' security features.  On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded 
guilty,  pursuant  to  a  single-count  information,  to  identity  fraud,  in  violation  of  18  U .S.C. 
§  1028(a)(7)  and  (b)(l)(D).  Plea Agreement,  United States v.  Richard Pinedo, No.  1:18-cr-24 
(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10.  The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the 
identity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him.  Pinedo's sales of 
account numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a  financial  network through 
which they transacted with U .S.  persons and companies.  See Gov't Sent. Mem. at 3, United States 
v.  Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2018), Doc. 24.  On October 10, 2018, Pinedo 
was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be followed by six months of home confinement, 
and was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. 

B.  Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations 

1.  Section 1030 Computer-Intrusion Conspiracy 

a.  Background 

On July 13, 2018, a federal  grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment 
charging Russian military intelligence officers from the GRU with conspiring to hack into various 
U.S. computers used by the Clinton Campaign, DNC, DCCC, and other U.S. persons, in violation 
of 18  U.S.C.  §§ 1030 and 371  (Count One); committing identity theft and conspiring to commit 
money laundering in  furtherance of that hacking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  §§  I 028A 
and  l 956(h) (Counts Two through Ten); and a separate conspiracy to hack into the computers of 
U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of the 2016 U.S. election, in violation 
of18U.S.C. §§ 1030and371 (CountEleven).  Netyksholndictment. 1277  Asofthiswriting,all 12 
defendants remain at large. 

The Netyksho indictment alleges that the defendants conspired with one another and with 
others to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential 
election,  steal  documents from  those computers,  and stage releases  of the  stolen  documents to 
interfere in the election.  Netyksho Indictment ,r 2.  The indictment also describes how, in staging

meetings with the Office of the Acting Attorney General before the indictment.

the  releases,  the  defendants  used  the  Guccifer  2.0  persona  to  disseminate  documents  through 
WikiLeaks.  On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 20,000 emails and other documents that 
the hacking conspirators had stolen from  the  DNC.  Netyksho  Indictment ,i 48.  In addition, on 
October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing emails that some conspirators had stolen from Clinton

1278  The Office also considered, but ruled out, charges on the theory that the post-hacking sharing 
and dissemination of emails could constitute trafficking in or receipt of stolen property under the National 
Stolen Property Act (NSPA),  18  U.S.C.  §§ 2314  and  2315.  The  statutes  comprising  the  NSPA  cover 
"goods,  wares,  or  merchandise," and lower coutts  have  largely  understood that phrase to be  limited  to 
tangible items since the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v.  United States,  473 U.S. 207 (1985).  See 
United States v.  Yijia Zhang, 995 F.  Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases).  One of those 
post-Dowling decisions-United States v.  Brown, 925  F.2d 1301  (10th Cir.  1991)-specifically held that 
the NSPA does not reach "a computer program in source code form," even though that code was stored in 
tangible items (i.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook).  Id.  at 1302-03.  Congress, in turn, cited the 
Brown opinion in explaining the need for  amendments to  18 U.S.C.  § 1030(a)(2) that "would ensure that 
the theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft 
of physical items [is] protected."  S.  Rep.  104-357, at 7 (1996).  That sequence of events would make it 
difficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, constitute 
"goods, wares, or merchandise" within the meaning of the NSPA.

connection  with  the  offense,  and  the  probable  sentence  to  be  im  osed  if the

C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts 

As  explained  in  Section  IV  above,  the  Office's  investigation  uncovered  evidence  of 
numerous  links  (i.e.,  contacts)  between  Trump  Campaign  officials  and  individuals  having  or 
claiming to have ties to the Russian government.  The Office evaluated the contacts under several 
sets of federal  laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate 
in the United States.  After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges 
under these  statutes  against  any  of the  individuals  discussed  in  Section  IV  above-with the 
exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on 
behalf of Ukraine. 

One of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals(cid:173)

the  June  9,  2016  meeting  between  high-ranking  campaign  officials  and  Russians  promising 
derogatory  information  on  Hillary  Clinton-implicates  an  additional  body  of law:  campaign(cid:173)
finance statutes.  Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources 
raise difficult statutory  and constitutional  questions.  As ex  lained  below,  the  Office  evaluated 
those questions in connection with the June 9 meeting 
The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably 
to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or 
individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law. 

Finally,  although  the  evidence  of  contacts  between  Campaign  officials  and  Russia(cid:173)

affiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several 
U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other 
steps to  obstruct the  Office's  investigation  and those  of Congress.  This  Office  has  therefore 
charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice. 

1.  Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion 

As  an initial  matter, this  Office evaluated  potentially criminal conduct that involved the 
collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of "collusion," but through the lens 
of conspiracy  law.  In so doing,  the  Office  recognized  that the  word "collud[ e ]" appears  in  the 
Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public 
reporting;  and  it is  sometimes referenced  in antitrust law, see,  e.g.,  Brooke  Group  v.  Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco  Corp.,  509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993).  But collusion is not a specific offense or 
theory of liability found  in the U.S. Code; nor is  it a term of art in federal criminal  law.  To the 
contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as 
that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371.  See Black 's Law 
Dictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is "[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain 
something forbidden  by  law");  1 Alexander Burrill, A  Law Dictionary and Glossary 311  (1871) 
("An agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ 
such forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object."); 1 Bouvier 's Law Dictionary 352 

180 

A:t:1:erttey Werk Predttet // Mtt;s CetttttiH Mttterittl Preteeted Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

(1897) ("An agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms 
of law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law."). 

For that reason, this Office' s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was 
on conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term "collusion."  The Office 
considered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked 
individuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy-either under statutes that have their 
own  conspiracy  language  (e.g. ,  18  U.S.C.  §§  1349,  195l(a)),  or under the  general  conspiracy 
statute (18 U.S.C. § 371).  The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume 
I,  Section IV, supra,  amounted to an  agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal 
criminal  law-
including  foreign-fnfluence  and  campaign-finance  laws,  both  of  which  are 
discussed further below.  The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the 
Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either 
under a specific statute or under Section 371 's offenses clause. 

The Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under 
Section 371 's defraud clause.  That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a 
lawful function of the U.S.  government or its agencies through deceitful or dishonest means.  See 
Dennis v.  United States,  384 U.S.  855,  861  (1966);  Hammerschmidt v.  United States, 265  U.S. 
182, 188 (1924); see also United States v.  Concord Mgmt.  & Consulting LLC, 34 7 F. Supp. 3d 38, 
46 (D.D.C.2018).  The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials(cid:173)
or between such officials  and Russia-linked  individuals-to interfere with or obstruct a  lawful 
function of a  government agency during the campaign or transition period.  And, as discussed in 
Volume I,  Section  V.A,  supra,  the  investigation  did  not identify  evidence that any  Campaign 
official or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the 
Office charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra. 
Accordingly,  the  Office  did  not  charge  any  Campaign  associate  or  other  U.S.  person  with 
conspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section 
IV above. 

2.  Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S.C. § 951) 

The Office next assessed  the potential  liability of Campaign-affiliated  individuals under 

federal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government. 

a.  Governing Law 

Under 18  U.S.C.  § 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a 
foreign  government without providing notice to  the Attorney  General.  Although the  defendant 
must act on behalf of a foreign government (as opposed to other kinds of foreign entities), the acts 
need not  involve  espionage;  rather,  acts  of any type  suffice for  liability.  See  United States v. 
Duran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709, 715 (7th 
Cir.  2009); United States v.  Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 581  (7th Cir. 2005).  An "agent of a foreign 
government"  is  an  " individual"  who  "agrees  to  operate"  in  the  United  States  "subject  to  the 
direction or control of a foreign government or official."  18 U.S.C. § 951 ( d). 

181

U.S. Department of Justice 

The crime defined by Section 951  is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States 
as an unregistered foreign-government agent.  18  U.S.C.  § 95l(a).  The statute does  not require 
willfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense.  United 
States v.  Campa,  529 F.3d 980, 998-99 (11th Cir. 2008); Duran, 596 F.3d at 1291-94; Dumeisi, 
424 F.3d at 581. 

The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) generally makes it illegal to act as an agent 
of a  foreign  principal  by  engaging  in  certain  (largely  political)  activities  in the United  States 
without registering with the  Attorney  General.  22 U.S.C.  §§ 611-621.  The triggering agency 
relationship must be with a  foreign principal or "a person any of whose activities are directly or 
indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a 
foreign principal."  22 U.S.C.  § 61 l(c)(l).  That includes a foreign government or political party 
and various foreign individuals and entities.  22 U.S.C. § 611(6).  A covered relationship exists if 
a person "acts as an agent, representative,  employee, or servant" or "in any other capacity at the 
order, request, or under the [foreign principal's] direction or control."  22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(l).  It 
is  sufficient  if the  person "agrees,  consents,  assumes  or purports to  act as, or who  is  or holds 
himself out  to  be,  whether  or not  pursuant  to  contractual  relationship,  an  agent  of a  foreign 
principal."  22 U.S.C. § 61 l(c)(2). 

The triggering activity is that the agent "directly or through any other person" in the United 
States (1) engages in "political activities for or in the interests of [the]  foreign principal," which 
includes attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as "public relations counsel, 
publicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such 
foreign principal"; (3) "solicits, collects, disburses,  or dispenses  contributions, loans,  money,  or 
other things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal"; or ( 4) "represents the interests 
of such foreign principal" before any federal agency or official.  22 U .S.C. § 611 ( c )(1 ). 

It is a crime to engage in a " [ w ]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation 
thereunder."  22  U.S.C.  § 618(a)(l).  It  is  also  a  crime  willfully  to  make  false  statements  or 
omissions  of  material  facts  in  FARA  registration  statements  or  supplements.  22  U.S.C. 
§ 618(a)(2).  Most violations have a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $10,000 
fine.  22 U.S.C.  § 618. 

b.  Application 

The investigation uncovered extensive evidence that Paul Manafort's and Richard Oates's 
pre-campaign work for the government of Ukraine violated FARA.  Manafort and  Gates  were 
charged  for that conduct and  admitted  to  it when  they  pleaded  guilty  to  superseding criminal 
informations in the District of Columbia prosecution.1280  The evidence underlying those charges 
is not addressed in this report because it was discussed in public court documents and in a separate

prosecution memorandum submitted to the Acting Attorney General before the original indictment 
in that case. 

In addition, the investigation produced evidence of FARA violations involving Michael 
Flynn.  Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey) 
and were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts  in the Statement of Offense that 
accompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge.  Statement of Offense,  United States v. 
Michael  T  Flynn,  No.  l:17-cr-232  (D.D.C.  Dec.  1,  2017),  Doc.  4  ("Flynn  Statement  of 
Offense"). 1281 

The investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any 
individual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the 
meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government 
of Russia, or any official thereof.  In particular, the Office did not find  evidence likely to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, 
and  Carter  Page  acted  as  agents  of the  Russian  overnrnent-or  at  its  direction  control,  or 
re  uest-durin  the  relevant time  eriod. 1282 

As a result, the Office did not charge 
any other Trump Campaign official with violating 
FARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to  do  so,  based on contacts with the Russian 
government or a Russian principal. 

Finally,  the  Office  investigated  whether  one  of the  above  campaign  advisors-George 
Papadopoulos-acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel. 
While  the  investigation  revealed  significant ties  between Papadopoulos  and  Israel  (and  search 
warrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence 
was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951. 

3.  Campaign Finance 

Several areas of the Office's investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to 
provide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that 
information to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign.  As explained below, the 
Office considered whether two of those efforts in particular-
the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump 

1282  On four occasions, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) issued  warrants based 
on a finding of probable cause to believe that Page was an agent of a foreign power.  50 U.S.C. §§  1801 (b ), 
1805(a)(2)(A).  The FISC's probable-cause finding was based on a different (and lower) standard than the 
one governing the Office's decision whether to bring charges against Page, which is whether admissible 
evidence would likely be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Page acted as an agent of the 
Russian Federation during the period at issue.  Cf United States v.  Cardoza, 713 F.3d 656, 660 (D.C. Cir. 
2013) ( explaining that probable cause requires only "a fair probability," and not "certainty, or proof beyond 
a reasonable doubt, or proof by a preponderance of the evidence").

---:-eonstituted prosecutable violations of 
the campaign-finance laws.  The Office determined that the evidence was not sufficient to charge 
either incident as a criminal violation. 

a.  Overview Of Governing Law 

"[T]he United States has a compelling interest ... in limiting the participation of foreign 
citizens in activities of democratic self-government, and in thereby preventing foreign  influence 
over  the  U.S.  political process."  Bluman  v.  FEC, 800  F.  Supp.  2d  281,  288  (D.D.C.  2011) 
(Kavanaugh, J., for three-judge court), ajf'd, 565 U.S. 1104 (2012).  To that end, federal campaign(cid:173)
law  broadly  prohibits  foreign  nationals  from  making  contributions,  donations, 
finance 
expenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, 
and prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations.  As 
relevant here, foreign nationals may not make- and no one may "solicit,' accept, or receive" from 
them-"a contribution or donation of money  or other thing of value" or "an express  or implied 
promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election." 
52  U.S.C.  § 30121(a)(l)(A), (a)(2). 1283  The term "contribution," which  is  used  throughout the 
campaign-finance law, "includes" "any gift, subscription, loan,  advance, or deposit of money or 
anything of value  made by  any  person  for  the purpose of influencing any election for Federal 
office."  52 U.S.C.  § 30101(8)(A)(i).  It excludes, among other things, "the value of [volunteer] 
services."  52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)(i). 

Foreign nationals are also barred from making "an expenditure, independent expenditure, 
or disbursement for an electioneering communication."  52  U.S.C.  § 30121(a)(l)(C).  The term 
"expenditure"  "includes" "any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of 
money or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for 
Federal office."  52 U.S.C.  §,30101(9)(A)(i).  It excludes, among other things, news stories and 
non-partisan  get-out-the-vote  activities.  52  U.S.C.  § 3010 I (9)(B)(i)-(ii).  An  " independent 
expenditure" is an expenditure "expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified 
candidate" and made independently of the campaign.  52 U.S.C. § 30101(17).  An "electioneering 
communication" is  a  broadcast communication that "refers to  a clearly identified candidate for 
Federal office" and  is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate. 
52 u.s.c. § 30104(f)(3). 

The statute defines  "foreign national"  by  reference  to  FARA  and  the  Immigration  and 
Nationality  Act,  with  minor  modification.  52  U.S.C.  § 30121(b)  (cross-referencing 22  U.S.C. 
§ 61 l(b)(l)-(3)  and  8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(20),  (22)).  That  definition  yields  five,  sometimes(cid:173)
overlapping  categories  of foreign  nationals,  which  include  all  of the  individuals  and  entities 
relevant  for  present purposes-namely,  foreign  governments  and  political  parties,  individuals 

1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), and 
prohibits contributions from  corporations,  banks,  and  labor  unions,  52 U.S.C.  § 3011 S(a);  see  Citizens 
United v.  FEC,  558  U.S.  310,  320  (2010).  Because the  conduct  that the  Office  investigated  involved 
possible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable 
provision.

A  "knowing□ and  willful[]"  violation  involving  an aggregate  of $25,000 or more  in  a 
calendar year  is  a  felony.  52  U.S.C.  § 30109(d)(l)(A)(i);  see Bluman,  800 F.  Supp.  2d  at 292 
(noting that a willful violation will require some "proof of the defendant's knowledge of the law"); 
United  States  v.  Danielczyk,  917 F.  Supp.  2d  573,  577  (E.D.  Va.  2013)  (applying willfulness 
standard drawn from Bryan v.  United States,  524 U.S.  184,  191-92 (1998)); see also  Wagner v. 
FEC, 793 F.3d 1, 19 n.23 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (en bane) (same).  A "knowing[] and willful[]" violation 
involving  an  aggregate  of $2,000  or  more  in  a  calendar  year,  but  less  than  $25,000,  is  a 
misdemeanor.  52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(ii). 

b.  Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting 

The  Office  considered  whether  to  charge  Trump  Campaign  officials  with  crimes  in 
connection with  the June  9  meeting described  in Volume I,  Section IV.A.5,  supra.  The Office 
concluded  that,  in  light  of the  government's  substantial  burden  of proof on  issues  of intent 
("knowing" and "willful"), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered  information, 
criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that "the admissible evidence will 
probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."  Justice Manual§ 9-27.220. 

In brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump 
Jr., to pass along from  Emin and Aras Agalarov an "offer" from Russia's "Crown prosecutor" to 
"the Trump campaign" of "official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and 
her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr. ' s]  father."  The email described 
this as  "very high  level  and  sensitive  information" that is  "part of Russia and  its  government's 
support to Mr.  Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin."  Trump Jr. responded: "if it's what you 
say  I  love  it  especially  later  in  the  summer."  Trump  Jr.  and  Emin  Agalarov  had  follow-up 
conversations  and,  within  days,  scheduled  a  meeting  with  Russian  representatives  that  was 
attended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner.  The communications setting up the meeting and 
the  attendance  by high-level  Campaign representatives  support an inference that the  Campaign 
anticipated  receiving derogatory documents and  information from  official  Russian sources  that 
could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects. 

This  series of events  could  implicate the  federal  election-law ban on contributions  and 
donations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. § 3012 l(a)(l )(A).  Specifically, Goldstone passed along 
an  offer  purportedly  from  a  Russian  government  official  to  provide  "official  documents  and 
information"  to the Trump  Campaign  for  the  purposes  of influencing the  presidential  election. 
Trump Jr.  appears to  have  accepted that offer and  to  have  arranged  a  meeting to receive  those 
materials.  Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner 
and Mana fort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt 
of helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources. 

The Office  considered whether this evidence would establish a  conspiracy to violate the 

foreign  contributions ban,  in  violation of 18 U.S.C.  §  371 ; the solicitation of an illegal foreign(cid:173)
source  contribution;  or the acceptance or receipt of "an express or  implied  promise  to  make a 

185 

Attomey Work Produet // Mtty CoHtttiH Mttterittl Proteetea Under Fea. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

[foreign-source] contribution," both in violation of 52 U.S.C. § 3012l(a)(l)(A), (a)(2).  There are 
reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a "thing of value" within the 
meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to 
obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons:  first, the Office did not obtain admissible 
evidence likely to meet the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these 
individuals acted "willfully," i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, 
second, the government would likely encounter difficulty  in proving beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 
U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(i). 

i.  Thing-of Value Element 

A  threshold  legal  question  is  whether  providing  to  a  campaign  "documents  and 
information" of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution.  The 
It  expressly  prohibits  "a 
foreign  contribution  ban  is  not  limited  to  contributions  of money. 
contribution or donation of money or other thing of value."  52 U.S.C.  § 3012l(a)(l)(A),  (a)(2) 
(emphasis added).  And the term "contribution" is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws 
to "include[]" "any gift,  subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value." 
52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added). 

The phrases "thing of value" and "anything of value"  are broad and inclusive enough to 
encompass at least some forms of valuable information.  Throughout the United States Code, these 
phrases serve as "term[ s] of art" that are construed " broad[ly]."  United States v.  Nilsen, 967 F .2d 
539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) ("thing of value" includes "both tangibles and intangibles"); 
see also,  e.g., 18 U.S.C.  §§ 20l(b)(l), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id.  § 641  (theft of government 
property).  For example, the  term  "thing of value"  encompasses  law enforcement reports  that 
would reveal the identity of informants, United States v.  Girard, 601  F.2d 69, 71  (2d Cir.  1979); 
classified  materials,  United States  v.  Fowler,  932  F.2d  306,  310  (4th  Cir.  1991);  confidential 
information about a competitive bid, United States v.  Matzkin, 14 F .3d 1014, I 020 ( 4th Cir. 1994); 
secret  grand jury  information,  United States  v.  Jeter,  775  F.2d  670,  680  (6th  Cir.  1985);  and 
information about a witness's whereabouts, United States v. Sheker, 618 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir. 
1980) (per curiam).  And in the public corruption context, " ' thing of value'  is defined broadly to 
include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received."  United States 
v.  Renzi, 769 F.3d 731,744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Federal Election  Commission (FEC) regulations recognize the value to a  campaign of at 
least some forms  of information, stating that the term "anything of value"  includes "the provision 
of any  goods  or services  without charge,"  such as  " membership  lists"  and  " mailing lists."  11 
C.F.R.  §  100.52(d)(l).  The FEC  has  concluded that the phrase  includes  a  state-by-state  list of 
activists.  See  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics  in  Washington  v.  FEC,  475  F.3d 337,  338 
(D.C. Cir.  2007) (describing the FEC's findings).  Likewise, polling data provided to a campaign 
constitutes a "contribution."  FEC Advisory Opinion 1990-12 (Strub), 1990 WL 153454 (citing 11 
C.F.R.  §  106.4(6)).  And  in  the  specific context of the  foreign-contributions  ban, the FEC has 
concluded  that  "election  materials  used  in  previous  Canadian  campaigns,"  including  "flyers, 
advertisements, door hangers, tri-folds, signs, and other printed material," constitute "anything of 

186 

Ati6rHe;  W6t1't Pr6dttet // Ma-;· C6HtaiH Ma-terial Pr6teeted UHder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

value," even though "the value of these materials may be nominal or difficult to ascertain."  FEC 
Advisory Opinion 2007-22 (Hurysz), 2007 WL 5172375, at *5. 

These authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given 
to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which 
the foreign-source ban could apply.  A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision offunds, 
but also  by  the  provision  of derogatory  information  about  an  opponent.  Political  campaigns 
frequently conduct and pay for opposition research.  A foreign entity that engaged in such research 
and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and 
a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things 
of  value.  At  the  same  time,  no  judicial  decision  has  treated  the  voluntary  provision  of 
uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount 
to  a  contribution  under  campaign-finance  law.  Such  an  interpretation could  have implications 
beyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign 
contributions), and raise First Amendment questions.  Those questions could be especially difficult 
where  the  information  consisted  simply  of the  recounting  of historically  accurate  facts. 
It  is 
uncertain how courts would resolve those issues. 

ii.  Willfulness 

Even  assuming  that  the  promised  "documents  and  information  that  would  incriminate 
Hillary"  constitute  a  "thing  of  value"  under  campaign-finance  law,  the  government  would 
encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction.  Most significantly, the 
government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  To  prove  that  a  defendant  acted  "knowingly  and  willfully,"  the 
government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was 
unlawful.  U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. 
2017) ("Election  Offenses"); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp.  2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation 
requires "proof of the defendant's knowledge of the law");  Danielczyk, 917 F.  Supp.  2d at 577 
("knowledge  of general  unlawfulness").  "This  standard  creates  an  elevated  scienter  element 
requiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear.  When 
there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the 
offender is more likely to have an intent defense."  Election Offenses 123. 

· 

On the facts  here,  the government would unlikely be  able to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. 
The investigation has  not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar 
with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal  law to the relevant factual context. 
The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or effo11s at concealment 
at the time of the June 9 meeting.  While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent 
disclosure of the nature of the June 9  meeting that could circumstantially provide support for  a 
showing of scienter, see Volume II,  Section  II.G,  infra, that concealment occurred more than a 
year later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an intention 
to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.  Additionally, in light 
of the unresolved legal questions about whether giving "documents and information" of the sort 
offered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he 

187 

Attorney Work Prod1:1et // Ma,· Cmnain Material Proteeted Under Fed. R.  Criffi. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

did not believe his response to the offer and the June 9 meeting itself violated the law.  Given his 
less  direct involvement in  arranging the  June  9  meeting,  Kushner could  likely mount a  similar 
defense.  And,  while  Manafort  is  experienced  with  political  campaigns,  the  Office  has  not 
developed evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues. 

iii.  Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information 

The  Office would  also  encounter difficulty  proving  beyond a  reasonable  doubt that the 
value  of the promised  documents  and  information exceeds the  $2,000 threshold  for  a  criminal 
violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment.  See 52 U.S.C.  § 30109(d)(l). 
The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such 
as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost 
or the  cost  of distribution-would  likely  be  unavailable  or  ineffective  in  this  factual  setting. 
Although  damaging  opposition  research  is  surely  valuable  to  a  campaign,  it  appears  that the 
information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable.  And while value in a conspiracy 
may well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, 
see, e.g., United States v.  Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir.  1982), Goldstone's description 
of the offered material  here  was quite  general.  His suggestion of the information's value-i.e., 
that it would "incriminate Hillary" and "would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father"-was non(cid:173)
specific  and  may  have  been  understood  as  being  of uncertain  worth  or  reliability,  given 
Goldstone's  lack of direct access  to  the original  source.  The  uncertainty  over what would be 
delivered  could be reflected  in Trump Jr. ' s  response ("if it's what you say I  love it")  (emphasis 
added). 

Accordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a 
campaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office 
decided  not to  pursue criminal  campaign-finance charges  against Trump  Jr.  or other campaign 
officials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting.

ii.  Willfulness 

As  discussed,  to  establish  a  criminal  campaign-finance  violation,  the  government  must 
prove that the defendant acted "knowingly  and willfully."  52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(l)(A)(i).  That 
standard requires proof that the defendant knew generally that his conduct was unlawful.  Election 
Offenses  123.  Given the uncertainties noted above, the "willfulness"  requirement would pose a 
substantial barrier to prosecution.

4.  False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation 

The  Office  determined  that  certain  individuals  associated  with  the  Campaign  lied  to 
investigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with 
the investigation.  As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected 
to the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses. 

a.  Overview Of Governing Law 

False  Statements.  The  principal  federal  statute  criminalizing  false  statements  to 
government investigators is 18 U.S.C.  § 1001.  As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a 
crime to knowingly and willfully "make[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement 
or  representation"  "in  any  matter  within  the jurisdiction  of the  executive  ... branch  of the 
Government." An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch's jurisdiction.  United 
States  v.  Rodgers, 466 U.S.  475,  479 (1984).  The statute also  applies to  a  subset of legislative 
branch  actions-viz., administrative  matters  and  "investigation[s]  or review[ s ]" conducted  by  a 
congressional committee or subcommittee.  18 U.S.C.  § 1001(c)(l) and (2); see  United States v. 
Pickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). 

Whether the statement was  made  to  law enforcement or congressional investigators,  the 
government must prove  beyond a  reasonable doubt the same  basic  non-jurisdictional elements: 
the statement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both that it was false and that 
it was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material.  See,  e.g., United 
States v.  Smith, 831  F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circuit 
Pattern Instruction 8.73  & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in 
light of the Department of Justice's position that the phrase "knowingly and willfully" in the statute 
requires the defendant's knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful).  In the D.C. Circuit, the 
government must prove that the statement was  actually false;  a statement that is misleading but 
"literally  true" does not satisfy  Section  1001 (a)(2).  See  United States v.  Milton,  8  F .3d  39, 45 

191 

A·tlerney Werk Predttet /,' Mfty Cm~tftil'l Mftteriftl Preteeted Ul'lder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6Ee) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

(D.C. Cir.  1993); United States v.  Dale, 991  F.2d 819, 832-33 &  n.22 (D.C. Cir.  1993).  For that 
false statement to qualify as "material," it must have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable 
of influencing, a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it is addressed.  See 
United States v.  Gaudin,  515  U.S.  506,  509 (1995);  United States v.  Moore,  612 F .3d 698,  701 
(D.C. Cir. 2010). 

Perjury.  Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath 
before a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1623.  The 
government must prove  four  elements  beyond a  reasonable  doubt to  obtain  a  conviction under 
Section  1623(a):  the defendant testified under oath before a  federal  grand jury; the defendant's 
testimony  was  false  in  one  or more  respects;  the  false  testimony  concerned  matters  that were 
material to the  grand jury investigation;  and  the  false  testimony  was knowingly given.  United 
States v.  Bridges,  717 F.2d  1444,  1449 n.30 (D.C.  Cir.  1983).  The  general  perjury  statute,  18 
U.S.C. §  1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, except that it requires 
that  the  witness  have  acted  willfully  and  that  the  government  satisfy  "strict  common-law 
requirements for establishing falsity."  See Dunn v.  United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979) 
(explaining "the two-witness rule" and the corroboration that it demands). 

Obstruction  of Justice.  Three  basic  elements  are  common  to  the  obstruction  statutes 
pertinent to this Office's charging decisions:  an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the 
obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent.  A detailed discussion 
of those  elements,  and  the  law  governing  obstruction of justice  more  generally,  is  included  in 
Volume II of the report. 

b.  Application to Certain Individuals 

i.  George Papadopoulos 

Investigators  approached Papadopoulos  for  an interview  based  on  his  role  as  a  foreign 
policy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign government representative 
that Russia had  indicated that  it could  assist the  Campaign through the anonymous  release of 
information  damaging to candidate  Clinton.  On January 27,  2017,  Papadopoulos  agreed  to  be 
interviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into 
potential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. 

During  the  interview,  Papadopoulos  lied  about  the  timing,  extent,  and  nature  of his 
communications with  Joseph  Mifsud,  Olga  Polonskaya,  and  Ivan  Timofeev.  With  respect to 
timing, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians 
had  "dirt"  on Clinton in the form of "thousands  of emails."  But Papadopoulos stated  multiple 
times that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a 
"very strange coincidence"  to  be told of the  "dirt" before he  started working for the Campaign. 
This account was false.  Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, 
2016,  after  Papadopoulos  had  already  learned  he  would  be  a  foreign  policy  advisor  for  the 
Campaign.  Mifsud  showed  interest  in  Papadopoulos  only  after  learning  of his  role  on  the 
Campaign.  And  Mifsud told  Papadopoulos  about the  Russians  possessing  "dirt"  on  candidate 
Clinton in  late April 2016, more than  a month after Papadopoulos had joined the  Campaign and 

192

been publicly announced by candidate Trump.  Statement of Offense ,r,r 25-26,  United States v. 
George Papadopoulos, No. 1: 17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Oct. 5, 2017), Doc. 19 ("Papadopoulos Statement 
of Offense"). 

Papadopoulos  also  made  false  statements  in  an  effort  to  mmumze  the  extent  and 
importance  of  his  communications  with  Mifsud.  For  example,  Papadopoulos  stated  that 
" [Mifsud]'s  a  nothing,"  that  he  thought Mifsud  was  "just  a  guy  talk[ing]  up  connections  or 
something," and that he believed Mifsud was "BS'ing to be completely honest with you."  In fact, 
however, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian 
government officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling 
Papadopoulos about the "dirt."  Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a 
period of months with Mifsud about foreign  policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to 
arrange a "history making" meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.  In 
addition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, 
the Russian national  who  Papadopoulos  understood to  be  connected to the  Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs,  despite  being asked  if he  had met with Russian  nationals or " [a]nyone with  a 
Russian accent" during the campaign.  Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r 27-29. 

Papadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campaign, 
and falsely told the FBI that he had "no" relationship at all with her.  He stated that the extent of 
their communications was her  sending  emails-"Just,  'Hi,  how are  you?'  That's it."  In truth, 
however, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he 
believed that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him 
arrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with 
her  over  Skype  on  numerous  occasions  about  the  potential  foreign  policy  trip  to  Russia. 
Papadopoulos Statement of Offense ,r,r 30-31. 

Papadopoulos's false  statements  in January  2017  impeded  the  FBI's  investigation  into 
Russian  interference  in  the  2016  presidential  election.  Most  immediately,  those  statements 
hindered investigators' ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby 
of a  Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017.  See Gov't Sent. Mem. at 6,  United States v. 
George Papadopoulos, No. 1 :17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug.  18, 2017), Doc. 44.  During that interview, 
Mifsud  admitted  to  knowing  Papadopoulos  and  to  having  introduced  him  to  Polonskaya  and 
Timofeev.  But Mifsud denied that he had advance  knowledge that Russia was  in  possession of 
emails  damaging  to  candidate  Clinton,  stating  that  he  and  Papadopoulos  had  discussed 
cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their 
conversation.  Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting  at 
which  Mifsud  introduced  him  to  Polonskaya,  even  though  emails,  text  messages,  and  other 
information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions-April 12 
and  April  26,  2016.  In  addition,  Mifsud  omitted  that he  had drafted  (or  edited)  the  follow-up 
message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected 
in  the  language of that email chain ("Baby, thank you!"), Mifsud may  have  been  involved  in  a 
personal  relationship  with  Polonskaya  at  the  time.  The  false  information  and  omissions  in 
Papadopoulos' s  January  20 17  interview  undermined  investigators'  ability  to  challenge  Mifsud 
when he made these inaccurate statements.

U.S. Department of Justice 

Given the seriousness of the lies and omissions and their effect on the FBI's investigation, 
the Office charged Papadopoulos with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1001.  Information,  United States v. George  Papadopoulos, No.  l:17-cr-182  (D.D.C.  Oct.  3, 
2017), Doc. 8.  On October 7, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to that charge pursuant to a plea 
agreement.  On September 7, 2018, he was sentenced to  14 days of imprisonment, a $9,500 fine, 
and 200 hours of community service. 

ii. -

iii.  Michael Flynn 

Michael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January 24, 2017, four days after he 
had  officially  assumed  his  duties  as  National  Security  Advisor to  the  President.  During  the 
interview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian 
ambassador. 

First, Flynn made two false  statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador 
Kislyak in late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia 
for  interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its  response.  See 
Flynn  Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents  that he  did  not ask Kislyak to  refrain  from 
escalating the situation in response to the United States's imposition of sanctions.  That statement 
was false.  On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint.  Flynn made 
the call immediately after speaking to  a  senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about 
what to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to 
report on the  substance  of that conversation.  Flynn  also  falsely  told  the FBI  that he  did  not 
remember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate 
its response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn's request.  On December 31, 2016, Flynn in 
fact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the 
call to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak.  See Flynn Statement of Offense ,r 3. 

194 

Attorney 1Nork Prodttet II :May Contain Ma:teria:l Preteeted Under Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

Second, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives 
of Russia  and  other countries regarding  a  resolution submitted  by  Egypt to  the  United  Nations 
Security  Council  on  December  21,  2016.  Specifically,  Flynn  stated  that  he  only  asked  the 
countries' positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any 
of the  countries  take  any  particular  action  on  the resolution.  That  statement  was  false.  On 
December 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration's 
opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution.  Flynn 
also  falsely  stated that Kislyak never  described  Russia's response to his December 22  request 
regarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that 
Russia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote.  See Flynn Statement of Offense 
,r 4. 

Flynn made these false  statements to the FBI  at a time when he was serving as National 
Security Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 
presidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia. 
Flynn's  false  statements  and  omissions  impeded  and  otherwise  had  a  material  impact  on  that 
ongoing investigation.  Flynn Statement of Offense ,r,r  1-2.  They also came shortly before Flynn 
made separate submissions to  the  Depa1tment of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained 
materially false statements and omissions.  Id.  ,r 5.  Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office 
decided  to  charge  Flynn  with  making  false  statements  to  the  FBI,  in  violation  of 18  U .S.C. 
§ l00l(a).  On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that 
charge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing.  See id.; Plea 
Agreement,  United States v.  Michael  T  Flynn, No.  l:17-cr-232 (D.D.C.  Dec.  1,  2017), Doc.  3. 
Flynn is awaiting sentencing. 

iv.  Michael Cohen 

Michael  Cohen  was  the  executive  vice  president  and  special  counsel  to  the  Trump 
Organization when  Trump  was  president  of the  Trump  Organization.  Information ,r 1,  United 
States v.  Cohen, No.  1 :18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2018), Doc. 2 ("Cohen Information").  From 
the fall  of 2015  through  approximately June 2016,  Cohen was  involved  in  a  project to  build  a 
Trump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow.  The project was known as Trump 
Tower Moscow. 

In  2017,  Cohen was called to  testify  before the  House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were 
investigating Russian  interference  in  the 2016 presidential  election  and possible  links  between 
Russia and the presidential campaigns.  In  late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen 
caused a  two-page statement to  be sent to  SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow. 
Cohen Information ,r,r 2-3.  The letter contained three representations relevant here.  First, Cohen 
stated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate 
Trump  on  the  project  only  three  times  before  making  the  unilateral  decision  to  terminate  it. 
Second, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project 
and never considered asking Trump to travel for the project.  Third, Cohen stated that he did not 
recall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that 

195 

Att:effle)' Werk Pl'ed1:1et /I Mey Cefl:taifl Material Pl'eteeted Uflder Fed. R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

he had sent to  a Russian government email account.  Cohen Information ,i 4.  Cohen later asked 
that his two-page statement be incorporated  into his testimony's transcript before SSCI, and  he 
ultimately gave testimony to SSCI that was consistent with that statement.  Cohen Information ,i 5. 

Each  of the  foregoing  representations  in  Cohen's  two-page  statement  was  false  and 
misleading.  Consideration  of the project had  extended  through  approximately  June  2016  and 
included more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix 
Sater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about the possibility of 
Trump traveling there- both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey 
Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian 
government spokesman Dmitry Peskov-in particular, that he received an email reply and had a 
follow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016. 
Cohen  Information ,i 7.  Cohen  knew  the  statements  in  the  letter to  be  false  at the  time,  and 
admitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump 
(who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false  impression that the project had ended 
before the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing 
Russia investigations.  Id. 

Given the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial 
interview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001.  On November 29, 2018, 
Cohen pleaded guilty pursuant to  a plea agreement to a  single-count information charging him 
with  making  false  statements  in  a  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of the  legislative  branch,  in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 100l(a)(2) and (c).  Cohen Information.  The case was transferred to the 
district judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District 
of New York (after a referral from  our Office).  On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a 
letter to that judge recommending that Cohen's cooperation with our investigation be taken into 
account in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern 
District  prosecution.  On  December  12,  2018,  the judge  sentenced  Cohen  to  two  months  of 
imprisonment  on  the  false-statements  count,  to  run  concurrently  with  a  36-month  sentence 
imposed on the other counts.

vi.  Jeff Sessions 

As set forth in Volume I, Section IV.A.6, supra, the investigation established that, while a 
U.S.  Senator and a  Trump Campaign advisor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions interacted 
with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the week of the Republican National Convention in July 
2016 and again at a meeting in Sessions' s Senate office in September 2016.  The investigation also 
established that Sessions and  Kislyak  both attended  a  reception held before  candidate Trump's 

197 

Atlot1ney 'Nork Pt1odttet // Mft)' Contain Matet1ial Pt10teeted Undet' Fed. R.  Ct1im. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and that it is 
possible that they met briefly at that reception. 

The Office considered whether, in  light of these interactions,  Sessions committed perjury 
before,  or made  false  statements to,  Congress  in  connection with his confirmation as  Attorney 
General.  In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response 
to a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had 
"been called  a  surrogate  at  a  time  or  two  in  that  campaign  and  I  didn't  have - did  not  have 
communications with the Russians."  In written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions 
answered "[n]o" to a question asking whether he had "been in contact with anyone connected to 
any part of the Russian government about the 2016  election, either before or after election day." 
And, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions identified two of the campaign-period 
contacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following 
the January 2017 confirmation hearing.  Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did 
"not  recall  any  discussions  with  the  Russian  Ambassador,  or any  other  representatives  of the 
Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion." 

Although  the  investigation  established  that  Sessions  interacted  with  Kislyak  on  the 
occasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one 
occasion,  the evidence  is not  sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false  answers to 
Russia-related questions  in light of the wording and context of those questions.  With respect to 
Sessions's  statements that he  did  "not recall  any discussions with the Russian Ambassador  . .. 
regarding the political campaign" and he had not been in contact with any Russian official "about 
the  2016 election,"  the  evidence  concerning the  nature  of Sessions's  interactions  with Kislyak 
makes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of 
his statements.  Similarly, while  Sessions stated in his  January 2017 oral testimony that he "did 
not have communications with Russians," he did so in response to a question that had linked such 
communications  to  an  alleged  "continuing  exchange  of  information"  between  the  Trump 
Campaign and Russian government intermediaries.  Sessions later explained to the Senate and to 
the Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with 
Russians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine 
contacts  with  Russian  nationals.  Given  the  context  in  which  the  question  was  asked,  that 
understanding is  plausible. 

Accordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Sessions 
was willfully untruthful  in his answers and thus insufficient to  obtain or sustain  a conviction for 
perjury  or false  statements.  Consistent with  the  Principles  of Federal  Prosecution,  the  Office 
therefore  determined  not  to  pursue charges  against  Sessions  and  informed  his  counsel  of that 
decision in March 2018. 

vii.  Others Interviewed During the Investigation 

The Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals 
interviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false. 
Applying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against 
In  some  instances,  that  decision  was  due  to 
any  individuals  other  than  those  listed  above.

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II 

This report is submitted to  the Attorney General  pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c), which 
states that, " [a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work,  he ... shall provide the Attorney 
General  a  confidential  report  explaining  the  prosecution  or  declination  decisions  [the  Special 
Counsel] reached ." 

Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the 
ongoing FBI  investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related 
matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice.  The Order appointing the 
Special Counsel gave  this Office jurisdiction to investigate  matters that arose directly  from  the 
FBI's Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in  connection 
with  Russia-related  investigations.  The  Special  Counsel's jurisdiction  also  covered potentially 
obstructive acts related to the  Special Counsel's investigation  itself.  This Volume of our report 
summarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President. 

We  first describe the considerations that guided  our obstruction-of-justice  investigation, 

and then provide an overview of this Volume: 

First,  a  traditional  prosecution  or  declination  decision  entails  a  binary  determination  to 
initiate  or  decline  a  prosecution,  but  we  determined  not  to  make  a  traditional  prosecutorial 
judgment.  The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that "the indictment 
or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the 
executive  branch  to  perform  its  constitutionally  assigned  functions"  in  violation  of  "the 
constitutional separation of powers."1  Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the 
Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; 
28 C.F.R.  § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC's legal  conclusion for the purpose of exercising 
prosecutorial jurisdiction.  And apart from OLC's constitutional view, we recognized that a federal 
criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to 
govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.2 

Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a  sitting President may not be prosecuted, 
it recognizes that a criminal investigation  during the President's term  is permissible.3  The OLC 
opinion also recognizes that a President does not have  immunity after he  leaves office.4  And if 
individuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at 
this  time.  Given those  considerations, the  facts  known  to  us,  and  the  strong  public  interest  in 

1 A  Sitting President's Amenability to  Indictment and Criminal Prosecution,  24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 

222, 260 (2000) (OLC Op.). 

2  See  U .S.  CONST.  Art.  I  §  2,  cl.  5;  §  3, cl.  6; cf OLC Op.  at 257-258  (discussing  relationship 

between impeachment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President). 

3  OLC Op. at 257 n.36 ("A grand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of 

immunity"). 

4  OLC Op. at 255 ("Recognizing an  immunity from  prosecution for a sitting  President would not 
preclude such  prosecution once the  President's term  is  over or he  is  otherwise  removed from  office by 
resignation or impeachment"). 

Aftt'lffle~·  Wt'lrlc Prt'lettet // May C6fltaifl Material Pr6teetee Ufleer Feel. R. Criffl. P. 6Ee) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

safeguarding  the  integrity  of the  criminal  justice  system,  we  conducted  a  thorough  factual 
investigation  in  order  to  preserve  the  evidence  when  memories  were  fresh  and  documentary 
materials were available. 

Third,  we  considered whether to evaluate  the  conduct we  investigated  under the  Justice 
Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply 
an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.  The 
threshold  step  under  the  Justice  Manual  standards  is  to  assess  whether  a  person's  conduct 
"constitutes a  federal offense."  U.S.  Dep't of Justice, Justice Manual§ 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice 
Manual).  Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges 
can be brought.  The ordinary means for an  individual to  respond  to  an accusation is  through a 
speedy and  public  trial,  with  all  the procedural  protections  that  surround  a  criminal  case.  An 
individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name.  In 
contrast, a prosecutor's judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, 
affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an  impartial adjudicator.5 

The concerns about the fairness  of such a determination would be heightened in the case 
of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor's accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, 
could carry consequences that extend beyond the  realm of criminal justice.  OLC  noted  similar 
concerns about sealed indictments.  Even if an indictment were sealed during the President's term, 
OLC  reasoned,  "it would  be  very  difficult  to  preserve  [an  indictment's]  secrecy,"  and  if an 
indictment became public, "[t]he stigma and opprobrium" could imperil the President's ability to 
govern."6  Although a prosecutor's internal report would not represent a formal public accusation 
akin to an indictment, the possibility of the report's public disclosure and the absence of a neutral 
adjudicatory  forum  to  review  its  findings  counseled  against  potentially  determining  "that the 
person's conduct constitutes a federal offense."  Justice Manual  § 9-27.220. 

Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough  investigation of the facts that the President 
clearly  did  not  commit  obstruction  of justice,  we would  so  state.  Based  on  the  facts  and  the 
applicable  legal  standards,  however,  we  are  unable  to  reach  that judgment.  The  evidence  we 
obtained  about the  President' s  actions and  intent presents  difficult  issues  that prevent us  from 
conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.  Accordingly, while this report does 
not conclude that the President committed a crime,  it also does not exonerate him.

This report on our investigation consists of four parts.  Section I provides an overview of 
obstruction-of-justice  principles  and  summarizes  certain 
investigatory  and  evidentiary 
considerations.  Section  II  sets  forth  the  factual  results  of our  obstruction  investigation  and 
analyzes  the  evidence.  Section  III addresses  statutory  and  constitutional  defenses.  Section  IV 
states our conclusion. 

5  For  that  reason,  criticisms  have  been  lodged  against  the  practice  of naming  unindicted  co(cid:173)
conspirators in an indictment.  See United States v.Briggs,514 F.2d 794,802 (5th Cir.  1975) ("The courts 
have struck down with strong language efforts by grand juries to accuse persons of crime while affording 
them no forum in which to vindicate themselves."); see also Justice Manual § 9-11.130.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II 

Our obstruction-of-justice  inquiry  focused  on  a  series  of actions  by  the  President  that 
related to  the Russian-interference investigations,  including the  President's conduct towards the 
law enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events. 

FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION 

The key issues and events we examined include the following: 

The Campaign's response to reports about Russian support for Trump.  During the 2016 
presidential  campaign,  questions  arose  about  the  Russian  government's  apparent  support  for 
candidate Trump.  After WikiLeaks released  politically damaging Democratic Party emails that 
were reported to  have  been  hacked  by  Russia,  Trump  publicly expressed skepticism that Russia 
was  responsible for  the  hacks  at  the same  time  that  he  and  other Campaign  officials  privately 
sought  information 
about  any  further  planned  WikiLeaks 
releases.  Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late 
as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a  licensing deal  for a  skyscraper to  be 
built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.  After the election, the President expressed concerns 
to  advisors  that  reports  of Russia's  election  interference  might  lead  the  public  to question  the 
legitimacy of his election. 

Conduct  involving  FBI Director  Comey  and Michael  Flynn.  In  mid-January  2017, 
incoming National  Security  Advisor Michael Flynn  falsely  denied  to  the Vice  President,  other 
administration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak 
about Russia' s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference.  On January 27, 
the day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar 
statements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Corney to a private dinner at the White 
House  and  told  Corney  that  he  needed  loyalty.  On  February  14,  the  day  after  the  President 
requested Flynn's resignation, the President told an outside advisor, "Now that we fired Flynn, the 
Russia thing is over."  The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue. 

Later that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to  have a one-on-one meeting 
with Corney.  Referring to the FBI's investigation of Flynn, the President said, "I hope you can 
see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  He is a good guy.  T hope you can let this 
go."  Shortly after requesting Flynn's resignation and speaking privately to Corney, the President 
sought to have Deputy National  Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an  internal  letter stating 
that the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak.  McFarland declined 
because she did  not know whether that was true,  and a  White House Counsel's Office attorney 
thought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered. 

The  President's  reaction  to  the  continuing  Russia  investigation.  Tn  February  2017, 

Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign(cid:173)
related investigations because of his role  in  the Trump Campaign.  Tn  early March, the President 
told White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing.  And after Sessions 
announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors 
that  he  should have an  Attorney General who would  protect him.  That weekend,  the President 
took Sessions  aside at an  event and  urged  him  to  "unrecuse."  Later in March,  Corney publicly 

3 

Aftefl'1e~· Werk Preettet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetea Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

disclosed  at a  congressional  hearing  that the  FBI  was  investigating "the Russian  government's 
efforts to  interfere in the 2016 presidential election," including any links or coordination between 
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.  In  the following days, the President reached 
out to  the  Director  of National  Intelligence and the  leaders  of the  Central  Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel 
the suggestion  that the President had any connection  to  the Russian  election-interference effort. 
The President also twice called Corney directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid 
direct contacts with the Department of Justice.  Corney had previously assured the President that 
the FBI was not investigating him  personally, and the President asked Corney to " lift the cloud" 
of the Russia investigation by saying that publicly. 

The  President's  termination  of Comey.  On  May  3,  2017,  Corney  testified  in  a 
congressional  hearing,  but  declined  to  answer  questions  about  whether  the  President  was 
personally  under  investigation.  Within days,  the  President decided to terminate Corney.  The 
President insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Corney 
had informed the President that he was not under investigation.  The day of the firing, the White 
House maintained that Corney's termination resulted from  independent recommendations from the 
Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Corney should be discharged for mishandling 
the  Hillary  Clinton  email  investigation.  But  the  President  had  decided  to  fire  Corney  before 
hearing from  the Department of Justice.  The day after firing Corney, the  President told Russian 
officials  that he  had  "faced  great  pressure  because  of Russia,"  which  had  been "taken  off'  by 
Corney's firing.  The next day, the President acknowledged in  a television  interview that he was 
going to fire Corney regardless of the Department of Justice's recommendation and that when he 
"decided to just do it," he was thinking that "this thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story." 
In response to a question about whether he was angry with Corney about the Russia investigation, 
the President said, "As far  as  I'm concerned, I want that thing to  be absolutely done properly," 
adding that firing Corney "might even lengthen out the investigation." 

The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him.  On May 17, 2017, the 
Acting Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the 
investigation and related matters.  The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been 
appointed by telling advisors that it was "the end of his presidency" and demanding that Sessions 
resign.  Sessions submitted his  resignation,  but the  President ultimately did  not accept  it.  The 
President told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special 
Counsel therefore could not serve.  The President's advisors told him  the asserted  conflicts were 
meritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice. 

On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel's Office was investigating 
whether the President had obstructed justice.  Press reports called this "a major turning point"  in 
the  investigation: while Corney had  told the  President he was  not under investigation, following 
Corney's firing, the President now was under  investigation.  The President reacted to this news 
with  a  series  of  tweets  criticizing  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Special  Counsel's 
investigation.  On June  17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call 
the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be 
removed.  McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather 
than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.

U.S. Department of Justice 

Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel's investigation.  Two days after directing McGahn 
to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of 
the Russia investigation.  On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with 
his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and 
dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions.  The message said that Sessions should 
publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation 
was "very unfair" to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to 
meet with the Special Counsel and "let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling 
for future elections."  Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do. 

One  month  later,  in  another  private  meeting  with  Lewandowski  on July  19,  2017,  the 
President  asked  about  the  status  of his  message  for  Sessions  to  limit  the  Special  Counsel 
investigation  to  future  election  interference.  Lewandowski  told  the  President that the  message 
would be delivered soon.  Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an 
interview with  the  New  York  Times,  and  then  issued  a  series  of tweets  making  it  clear that 
Sessions's job was  in jeopardy.  Lewandowski  did not want to deliver the President's message 
personally,  so  he  asked  senior  White  House  official  Rick  Dearborn  to  deliver  it  to  Sessions. 
Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through. 

Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.  In  the  summer of 2017, the  President 
learned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower 
between  senior campaign officials,  including Donald Trump Jr., and a  Russian  lawyer who was 
said  to  be  offering  damaging  information  about  Hillary  Clinton  as  "part  of Russia  and  its 
government's support for  Mr. Trump."  On  several occasions, the President directed aides not to 
publicly disclose the emails setting up  the June 9  meeting, suggesting that the emails would not 
leak and that the  number of lawyers with  access  to  them  should  be  limited.  Before the  emails 
became  public,  the  President  edited  a  press  statement  for  Trump  Jr.  by  deleting  a  line  that 
acknowledged  that the  meeting was  with  "an individual  who  [Trump  Jr.]  was told  might  have 
information helpful to the campaign" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions 
of Russian children.  When the press asked questions about the President' s involvement in Trump 
Jr.' s  statement,  the  President's personal  lawyer repeatedly denied  the  President had  played  any 
role. 

Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation.  In early 
summer 2017,  the President called Sessions at home and again asked him  to  reverse  his  recusal 
from the Russia investigation.  Sessions did not reverse his recusal.  In October 2017, the President 
met privately with Sessions  in  the Oval Office and asked him  to "take  [a]  look" at investigating 
Clinton. 
In  December  2017,  shortly  after  Flynn  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation 
agreement, the President met with Sessions in  the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes 
taken  by  a  senior advisor,  that  if Sessions  unrecused  and took back  supervision  of the  Russia 
investigation, he would be a "hero."  The President told  Sessions, "I'm not going to do anything 
or direct you to do anything.  I just want to be treated fairly."  In response, Sessions volunteered 
that he had  never seen anything "improper"  on the campaign and told the President there was a 
"whole new leadership team" in place.  He did not unrecuse. 

Efforts to have McGahn deny that the  President had ordered him to  have the Special 
Counsel removed.  In  early  2018,  the press  reported  that the President had  directed McGahn to

U.S. Department of Justice 

have the Special Counsel removed  in  June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather 
than  carry  out the  order.  The  President reacted  to  the  news  stories  by directing  White  House 
officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to 
have  the  Special  Counsel  removed.  McGahn  told  those  officials  that  the  media  reports  were 
accurate in  stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed. 
The  President then  met with  McGahn  in  the  Oval  Office  and again  pressured  him  to  deny the 
reports.  In  the  same meeting,  the  President also  asked  McGahn  why  he  had  told  the  Special 
Counsel about the President' s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes 
of his conversations with the President.  McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered 
happening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle. 

Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort,~.  After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense 
agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President' s personal 
counsel  left a  message  for Flynn' s  attorneys  reminding  them  of the  President's warm  feelings 
towards  Flynn,  which  he  said  "still  remains,"  and  asking  for  a  " heads  up"  if Flynn  knew 
"information that implicates the President."  When Flynn' s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no 
longer share information  pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President's personal counsel 
said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn's actions reflected " hostility" towards 
the  President.  During  Manafort' s  prosecution  and  when  the  jury  in  his  criminal. trial  was 
deliberating,  the  President  praised  Manafort  in  public,  said  that  Manafort  was  being  treated 
unfairly,  and  declined to rule  out a  pardon.  After Manafort was convicted, the President called 
Manafort "a brave  man"  for  refusin 
in  "  "almost  ou  ht  to  be 

to  "break"  and  said  that  "fli 

Conduct involving Michael Cohen.  The President' s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a 
former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized 
the President's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when 
he became a  cooperating witness.  From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the 
Trump Tower Moscow project on  behalf of the Trump Organization and  had briefed  candidate 
Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia 
to  advance  the  deal.  In  2017,  Cohen  provided  false  testimony  to  Congress about  the  project, 
including stating that he  had only briefed Trump on  the  project three times and never discussed 
travel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a " party line" that Cohen said was developed to 
minimize the President's connections to Russia.  While preparing for his congressional testimony, 
Cohen had extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, 
said that Cohen should "stay on message" and not contradict the President.  After the FBI searched 
Cohen's  home  and  office  in  April  2018,  the  President publicly asserted  that Cohen  would  not 
"flip," contacted him directly to tell him to "stay strong," and privately passed messages of support 
to him.  Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if 
he  stayed on  message  he would  be taken  care of.  But after  Cohen began  cooperating with the 
government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him  a "rat," and 
suggested that his family members had committed crimes.

Overarching factual  issues.  We  did  not make a  traditional  prosecution  decision  about 
these facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President' s 
conduct. 

Several features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of(cid:173)

justice cases.  First,  the  investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions,  such  as 
firing the FBI director,  involved facially  lawful  acts within  his  Article II authority, which raises 
constitutional  issues discussed below.  At the same time,  the President's position as  the  head of 
the  Executive  Branch  provided  him  with  unique  and  powerful  means  of influencing  official 
proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses-all of which is relevant to a potential 
obstruction-of-justice analysis.  Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of 
justice  to  cover  up  a  crime,  the  evidence  we  obtained  did  not establish  that  the  President  was 
involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.  Although the obstruction 
statutes do not require proof of such a  crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of 
the President's intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct.  Third, 
many of the President's acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with 
the  government  and  suggestions  of possible  future  pardons,  took  place  in  public  view.  That 
circumstance  is  unusual,  but  no  principle  of law  excludes  public  acts  from  the  reach  of the 
obstruction laws.  If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, 
the harm to the justice system's integrity is the same. 

Although the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of 
the President's conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President' s 
acts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent.  In particular, the actions we investigated 
can  be divided into  two phases,  reflecting a  possible shift in the President's motives.  The  first 
phase covered the period from the President' s first interactions with Corney through the President's 
firing of Corney.  During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally 
under investigation.  Soon after the firing of Corney and the appointment of the Special Counsel, 
however,  the  President  became  aware  that  his  own  conduct  was  being  investigated  in  an 
obstruction-of-justice inquiry.  At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct, 
involving public attacks on  the inve~tigation,  non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in  both 
public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.  Judgments about 
the nature of the President's motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the 
evidence. 

STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES 

The  President's  counsel  raised  statutory  and  constitutional  defenses  to  a  possible 
obstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated.  We concluded that none of those 
legal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts. 

Statutory  defenses.  Consistent with  precedent and the  Department of Justice's  general 
approach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here. 
See  18  U.S.C.  §§  1503,  1505,  1512(b)(3),  1512(c)(2).  Section  1512(c)(2)  is  an  omnibus 
obstruction-of-justice  provision  that covers  a  range  of obstructive  acts  directed  at  pending  or 
contemplated official proceedings.  No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the 
provision to cover only conduct that impairs  the  integrity or availability  of evidence.  Sections 
1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, 

7 

Attemey Werle Predttet // May CeHtaiH Material Preteeted UH.tier Fed. R. Crim. P.  6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

judicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision 
in Section  1512(6) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication 
to law enforcement of information related to a federal crime. 

Constitutional defenses.  As for constitutional defenses arising from the President's status 
as the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts 
have  not. definitively  resolved  these  issues.  We  therefore  examined  those  issues  through  the 
framework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues.  The 
Department of Justice and the President's personal counsel  have recognized that the President is 
subject to statutes  that prohibit obstruction  of justice by  bribing a  witness or suborning  perjury 
because that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority.  With respect to whether the 
President ca,n  be found to  have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the 
Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his 
authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. 

Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution  does  not categorically  and 
permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II  powers. 
The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to  protect official proceedings, including 
those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regard less of their source.  We also 
concluded that any inroad on presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts 
does  not  undermine  the  President's  ability  to  fulfill  his  constitutional  mission.  The  term 
"corruptly" sets a demanding standard.  It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an 
intent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty 
and the rights ofothers.  A preclusion of"corrupt" official action does not diminish the President's 
ability to exercise Article II powers.  For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not 
demand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal 
punishment, avoiding financial  liability, or preventing personal embarrassment.  To the contrary, 
a  statute that prohibits official action  undertaken for  such  corrupt purposes furthers,  rather than 
hinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law.  It also aligns with the President's 
constitutional  duty to faithfully  execute the laws.  Finally, we concluded that  in  the rare case in 
which  a  criminal  investigation  of the  President' s  conduct  is  justified,  inquiries  to  determine 
whether the President acted for a  corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance 
of his constitutionally assigned duties.  The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction 
laws to  the  President' s  corrupt exercise  of the powers of office  accords  with our constitutional 
system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law. 

CONCLUSION 

Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw 
ultimate  conclusions  about  the  President' s  conduct.  The  evidence  we  obtained  about  the 
President's actions and  intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved  if we were 
making a  traditional  prosecutorial judgment.  At  the  same  time,  if we had  confidence  after  a 
thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, 
we would so state.  Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach 
that judgment.  Accordingly, while this  report does not conclude that the President committed a 
crime, it also does not exonerate him.

I.  BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES 

A. 

Legal Framework of Obstruction of Justice 

The May  17,  2017 Appointment Order and  the  Special Counsel  regulations  provide this 
Office with jurisdiction to investigate "federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent 
to  interfere  with,  the  Special  Counsel's  investigation,  such  as  perjury,  obstruction  of justice, 
destruction of evidence,  and  intimidation of witnesses."  28 C.F.R.  § 600.4(a).  Because of that 
description of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with 
the elements of obstruction offenses in mind.  Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the 
elements of such offenses,  although we do  not draw conclusions on the  ultimate  questions  that 
govern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution.  See Justice Manual 
§ 9-27.000 et seq.  (2018). 

Here,  we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction 
statutes in an ordinary case.  This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that 
arise in an inquiry into official acts by the President.  Those issues are discussed in a later section 
of this  report  addressing  constitutional  defenses  that the  President' s  counsel  have  raised.  See 
Volume II, Section III.B, irifra. 

Three  basic elements  are  common  to  most of the  relevant obstruction  statutes:  ( 1)  an 
obstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt 
intent.  See, e.g. ,  18 U.S.C. §§  1503,  1505,  1512(c)(2).  We describe those elements as they have ' 
been interpreted by the courts.  We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering, 
see  18  U.S.C.  §  1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to 
obstruct justice, see  18 U.S.C. §§  I 503, 1512(c)(2). 

Obstructive  act.  Obstruction-of-justice  law  "reaches  all  corrupt  conduct  capable  of 
producing an effect that prevents justice from  being duly administered,  regardless of the  means 
employed."  United States v.  Silverman,  745  F.2d  1386,  1393  (11th Cir.  1984) (interpreting  18 
U .S.C.  §  1503).  An  "effort  to  influence" a  proceeding  can qualify  as  an endeavor to  obstruct 
justice  even  if the  effort  was  "subtle  or  circuitous"  and  "however  cleverly  or  with  whatever 
cloaking of purpose"  it was made.  United States v.  Roe, 529  F.2d 629,632 (4th Cir.  1975); see 
also United States v.  Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006).  The verbs '"obstruct or impede' 
are broad" and "can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders ."  Marinello v.  United 
States, 138 S. Ct. 1101,  1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). 

An improper motive can render an actor's conduct criminal even when the conduct would 
otherwise be  lawful and within the actor's authority.  See  United States v.  Cueto,  151  F.3d 620, 
631  (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for "litigation(cid:173)
related conduct");  United States v.  Cintolo,  818 F .2d 980,  992 (1st Cir.  1987) ("any act by any 
party-whether lawful or unlawful  on its face-may abridge §  1503  if performed with a corrupt 
motive"). 

Nexus  to  a  pending  or contemplated official proceeding.  Obstruction-of-justice  law 
generally requires a  nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding.  In Section  1503, the nexus 
must be to  pending "judicial or grand jury proceedings."  United States v.  Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 

9 

AttorHe".Y'  Werle Proattet // May CoHtaiH Material Proteetea UHaer Fee. R. Criffl. P. 6(e) 

U.S.  Department of Justice 

599 (1995).  In Section  1505, the nexus can include a connection to a "pending" federal  agency 
proceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation.  Under both statutes, the government must 
demonstrate  "a  relationship  in  time,  causation,  or  logic"  between  the  obstructive  act  and  the 
proceeding or inquiry to be obstructed.  Id.  at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v.  United States, 
544  U.S.  696,  707-708  (2005).  Section  I 5 I 2(c)  prohibits obstructive  efforts  aimed  at  official 
proceedings  including judicial  or grand  jury  proceedings.  18  U.S.C.  § 15 l 5(a)(l )(A).  "For 
purposes of' Section  1512, "an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be  instituted 
at the time of the offense."  18 U.S.C. § 15 l 2(f)(l ).  Although a proceeding need not already be in 
progress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must 
be shown.  United States v.  Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v.  Petruk, 781 
F.3d 438, 445  (8th  Cir.  2015);  United States v.  Phillips, 583  F.3d  1261,  1264 (10th  Cir.  2009); 
United States  v.  Reich, 479 F.3d  179,  186 (2d  Cir. 2007).  The nexus  requirement narrows the 
scope  of obstruction  statutes  to  ensure  that  individuals  have  "fair  warning"  of what  the  law 
proscribes.  Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

The nexus showing has  subjective and objective components.  As  an  objective matter,  a 
defendant must act "in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,"  such that the statute "excludes 
defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably 
be successful."  Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 ( emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). 
"[T]he  endeavor  must  have  the  natural  and  probable  effect  of  interfering  with  the  due 
administration  of justice."  Id.  at  599  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  As  a 
subjective  matter,  the  actor  must  have  "contemplated  a  particular,  foreseeable  proceeding." 
Petruk,  781  F .3d at 445-446 ..  A defendant need  not directly  impede the proceeding.  Rather,  a 
nexus exists if "discretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial 
proceeding if it was foreseeable to the defendant that the third party would act on the [defendant' s] 
communication in  such a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding."  United States v.  Martinez, 
862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted). 

Corruptly.  The word "corruptly" provides the intent element for obstruction of justice and 
means  acting  "knowingly  and  dishonestly"  or  "with  an  improper  motive."  United  States  v. 
Richardson,  676 F.3d  491,  508 (5th Cir. 2012);  United States  v.  Gordon,  710  F.3d  1124,  1151 
(I 0th  Cir.  2013)  (to  act  corruptly  means  to "act[]  with  an  improper  purpose  and  to  engage  in 
conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific  intent to  subvert,  impede or obstruct" the 
relevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U .S.C. § 1515(6) ("As used in section 
1505, the term  'corruptly'  means acting with an  improper purpose,  personally  or by  influencing 
another.");  see  also  Arthur Andersen,  544  U.S.  at 705-706  (interpreting  "corruptly"  to  mean 
"wrongful,  immoral,  depraved,  or evil" and holding that acting "knowingly ... corruptly"  in  18 
U.S.C. §  1512(6) requires "consciousness of wrongdoing").  The requisite showing is made when 
a  person  acted  with  an  intent  to  obtain an  "improper advantage for  [him]self or someone else, 
inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others."  BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d 
ed.  1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F .3d 1122,  1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 
616  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in  part and  dissenting  in  part)  (characterizing  this  definition  as  the 
" longstanding and well-accepted meaning" of "corruptly"). 

Witness tampering.  A more specific provision in Section 151 2 prohibits tampering with a 
witness.  See  18  U.S.C. § 1512(6 )(I), (3) (making it a crime to "knowingly use[]  intimidation  ... 
or corruptly  persuade[]  another  person,"  or  "engage[]  in  misleading  conduct  towards  another

person," with the intent to "influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official 
proceeding" or to "hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a  law enforcement officer . . . 
of information  relating  to  the  commission  or possible  commission  of a  Federal  offense").  To 
establish corrupt persuasion,  it is sufficient that the  defendant asked a  potential witness to  lie to 
investigators in contemplation of a  likely federal  investigation into his conduct.  United States v. 
Ed/ind,  887 F.3d  166,  174  (4th  Cir.  2018);  United States v.  Sparks, 791  F.3d  1188,  1191-1192 
(10th Cir. 2015);  United States  v.  Byrne,  435 F.3d  16,  23-26  (1st Cir. 2006);  United States v. 
LaShay,  417 F .3d 715, 718-719  (7th Cir. 2005);  United States v.  Burns,  298 F .3d 523,  539-540 
(6th  Cir.  2002);  United  States  v.  Pennington,  168  F.3d  1060,  1066  (8th  Cir.  1999).  The 
"persuasion" need  not  be  coercive,  intimidating,  or explicit;  it  is  sufficient to "urge," "induce," 
" ask[]," "argu[ e ]," "giv[ e] reasons,"  Sparks, 791  F .3d at 1192, or "coach[] or remind[] witnesses 
by planting misleading facts,"  Ed/ind,  887 F.3d  at 174.  Corrupt persuasion  is  shown "where a 
defendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the witness 
believe the story and testify to  it."  United States v.  Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77,  82 (2d Cir.  1986); see 
United States v.  Gabriel, 125 F .3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997).  It also covers urging a witness to recall 
a  fact that the witness did  not know,  even if the fact was actually true.  See LaShay, 417 F .3d at 
719.  Corrupt  persuasion  also  can  be  shown  in  certain  circumstances  when  a  person,  with  an 
improper motive,  urges  a  witness  not  to cooperate  with  law enforcement.  See  United States  v. 
Shotts,  145 F.3d 1289, 1301  (11th Cr.  1998) (telling Secretary "not to [say] anything [to the FBI] 
and [she] would not be bothered"). 

When the charge is acting with the intent to  hinder,  delay, or prevent the communication 
of information to law enforcement under Section  l 512(b)(3), the "nexus" to a  proceeding inquiry 
articulated in Aguilar-that an individual have " knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the 
judicial proceeding," 515  U.S. at 599-does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the 
communication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding. 

Acting "knowingly  ... corruptly"  requires  proof that  the  individual  was  "conscious  of 
wrongdoing."  Arthur Andersen, 544 U .S. at 705-706 (declining to explore "[t]he outer limits of 
this element" but indicating that an  instruction was infirm  where it permitted conviction even  if 
the defendant "honestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful").  It is an affirmative 
defense that "the conduct consisted solely oflawful conduct.and that the defendant' s sole intention 
was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully."  18 U.S.C. § 1512(e). 

Attempts and endeavors.  Section  I 512( c )(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses 
and attempts to obstruct justice.  Under general  principles of attempt law, a  person is guilty of an 
attempt  when  he  has  the  intent  to  commit  a  substantive  offense  and  takes  an  overt  act  that 
constitutes a  substantial step towards  that goal.  See  United States v.  Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 
102, 106-107 (2007).  "[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the 
defendant's criminal purpose."  United States v.  Pratt, 351  F.3d  131,  135  (4th Cir. 2003).  While 
"mere  abstract  talk"  does  not  suffice,  any  "concrete  and  specific"  acts  that  corroborate  the 
defendant's intent can constitute a "substantial step."  United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184,  1198-
1205 (10th Cir. 2011).  Thus, " soliciting an  innocent agent to engage in  conduct constituting an 
element of the crime" may qualify as a substantial step.  Model Penal Code § 5 .01 (2)(g); see United 
States v. Lucas, 499 F .3d 769, 781  (8th Cir. 2007).

U.S. Department of Justice 

The omnibus clause of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 prohibits an "endeavor" to obstruct justice, which 
sweeps more broadly than  Section  1512's attempt provision.  See  United States v.  Sampson,  898 
F.3d 287,302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v.  Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347,  1366-1367 (8th Cir.  1988) 
( collecting  cases).  "It  is  well  established  that  a[ n]  [obstruction-of-justice]  offense  is  complete 
when  one  corruptly  endeavors  to  obstruct  or  impede  the  due  administration  of justice;  the 
prosecution  need  not  prove  that  the  due  administration  of justice  was  actually  obstructed  or 
impeded."  United States v.  Davis, 854 F .3d  1276, 1292 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 

B. 

Investigative and Evidentiary Considerations 

After  the  appointment of the  Special Counsel,  this  Office obtained  evidence  about  the 

following events relating to potential issues of obstruction of justice involving the President: 

(a)  The President's January 27, 2017 dinner with former FBI Director James Corney in which 
the President reportedly asked  for Corney's loyalty,  one day after the White House had 
been briefed by the Department of Justice on contacts between former National Security 
Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian Ambassador; 

(b)  The President's February 14, 2017 meeting with Corney in which the President reportedly 

asked Corney not to pursue an investigation of Flynn; 

(c)  The President's private requests to Corney to make public the fact that the President was 
not the subject of an FBI investigation and to lift what the President regarded as a cloud; 

(d) The President' s outreach to the Director of National Intelligence and the Directors of the 
National  Security Agency and the  Central Intelligence Agency about the FBI's Russia 
investigation; 

(e)  The  President's  stated  rationales  for  terminating  Corney  on  May  9,  2017,  including 
statements that could reasonably be understood as acknowledging that the FBT's Russia 
investigation was a factor in Corney's termination; and 

(f)  The President's reported involvement in issuing a statement about the June 9, 2016 Trump 
Tower  meeting  between  Russians and  senior Trump  Campaign  officials  that  said  the 
meeting  was  about  adoption  and  omitted that  the Russians  had  offered to provide  the 
Trump Campaign with derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. 

Taking  into  account that  information  and our analysis  of applicable statutory and  constitutional 
principles  (discussed  below  in  Volume  II,  Section  III,  infra),  we determined  that  there  was  a 
sufficient  factual  and  legal  basis  to  further  investigate  potential  obstruction-of-justice  issues 
involving the President. 

Many of the core issues in  an obstruction-of-justice investigation  turn  on an individual' s 
actions  and intent.  We  therefore requested that the  White  House provide us  with  documentary 
evidence in its possession on the relevant events.  We also sought and obtained the White House's 
concurrence in our conducting interviews of White House personnel who had relevant information. 
And  we  interviewed  other witnesses  who  had  pertinent  knowledge,  obtained  documents  on  a 

12 

Attorney Work Protittet // May Cmtt1:tifl  Material Proteeteti Ut1der Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

voluntary basis when possible, and used legal process where appropriate.  These investigative steps 
allowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence. 

We  also  sought  a  voluntary  interview  with  the  President.  After  more 

discussion, the President declined to be interviewed. 

During the course of our discussions, 
the  President  did  agree  to  answer  written  questions  on  certain  Russia-related  topics,  and  he 
provided us with answers.  He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on 
obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition.  Ultimately, while we believed that 
we had the authority and legal justification to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President's 
testimony, we chose not to do so.  We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such 
an  investigative step would  likely produce at a late stage in our investigation.  We also assessed 
that based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President's actions 
and his  public and  private statements  describing  or explaining those actions,  we  had  sufficient 
evidence to understand  relevant events and to make  certain  assessments without the President's 
testimony.  The  Office's  decision-making  process  on  this  issue  is  described  in  more  detail  in 
Appendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President' s written responses. 

In assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply  in  any 
investigation.  The  issue of criminal  intent  is often inferred from  circumstantial evidence.  See, 
e.g.,  United States v.  Croteau,  819 F.3d  1293,  1305  (I Ith Cir. 2016) ("[G]uilty knowledge can 
rarely be  established by direct evidence .... Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or 
intent  may be  proved  by  circumstantial  evidence.") (internal  quotation  marks omitted);  United 
States  v.  Robinson,  702  F.3d  22,  36  (2d  Cir.  2012)  ("The  government's  case  rested  on 
circumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often  be proved 
through  circumstantial  evidence  and  the  reasonable  inferences  drawn  therefrom." )  (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  The principle that intent can be  inferred from circumstantial evidence 
is a necessity in criminal cases, given the right ofa subject to assert his privilege against compelled 
self-incrimination  under  the  Fifth  Amendment  and  therefore  decline  to  testify.  Accordingly, 
determinations  on  intent  are  frequently  reached  without  the  opportunity  to  interview  an 
investigatory subject. 

Obstruction-of-justice cases  are  consistent with  this  rule.  See,  e.g.,  Ed/ind,  887 F.3d at 
174, 176 (relying on "significant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious of her 
wrongdoing"  in  an  obstruction  case;  "[b]ecause  evidence  of  intent  will  almost  always  be 
circumstantial,  a  defendant  may  be  found  culpable  where  the  reasonable  and  foreseeable 
consequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice")  (internal quotation  marks,  ellipses, and 
punctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441  F.3d at 173-174.  Circumstantial evidence that  illuminates 
intent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts.  Fed. R. Evid. 404(6) ("Evidence of a 
crime, wrong, or other act ... may be  admissible  . . .  [to]  prov[ e]  motive,  opportunity,  intent, 
preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident."); see, e.g., United 
States v.  Frankhauser, 80 F .3d 641 ,  648-650 ( I st Cir.  1996);  United States v.  Arnold, 773 F .2d 
823, 832-834 (7th Cir.  1985); Cintolo,  818 F .2d at 1000. 

Credibility  judgments  may  also  be  made  based  on  objective  facts  and  circumstantial 
evidence.  Standard jury  instructions  highlight  a  variety  of factors  that  are  often  relevant  in 

13 

A1:teffley Werk Predttet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteeted Uttder Fed. R. Crim.. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

assessing credibility.  These include whether a witness had a reason not to tell the truth; whether 
the witness had  a  good memory; whether the witness had  the opportunity to observe the  events 
about which he testified; whether the witness' s  testimony was corroborated  by other witnesses; 
and whether anything the  witness said  or wrote previously contradicts  his  testimony.  See,  e.g., 
First  Circuit  Pattern  Jury  Instructions  §  1.06  (2018);  Fifth  Circuit  Pattern Jury  Instructions 
(Criminal Cases) § 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction § 3.0 l  (2012). 

In addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in assessing 
the credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts.  For example, contemporaneous written notes 
can provide strong corroborating evidence.  See United States v.  Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) 
(the  fact  that a  "statement appeared  in  the contemporaneously  recorded  report  ... would  tend 
strongly  to  corroborate  the  investigator's  version  of the  interview").  Similarly,  a  witness's 
recitation  of his  account  before  he  had  any  motive  to  fabricate  also  supports  the  witness' s 
credibility.  See  Tome  v.  United States,  513  U.S.  150,  158  (l 995) (" A  consistent  statement that 
predates  the  motive  is  a  square  rebuttal  of the  charge  that  the  testimony  was  contrived  as  a 
consequence of that motive.").  Finally, a witness's  false  description  of an  encounter can imply 
consciousness of wrongdoing.  See Al-Adahi v.  Obama,  613  F.3d  1102,  1107 (D.C.  Cir.  2010) 
(noting the  "well-settled  principle  that false  exculpatory statements are evidence-often strong 
evidence-of guilt").  We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of 
our investigation.

II.  FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION 

This section of the report details the evidence we obtained.  We first provide an overview 
of how Russia  became  an  issue  in  the 2016  presidential  campaign,  and  how candidate  Trump 
responded.  We then tum to the key events that we investigated: the President's conduct concerning 
the FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President's reaction to public confirmation of the FBI ' s 
Russia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Corney; 
efforts  to  terminate  the  Special  Counsel;  efforts  to  curtail  the  scope  of the  Special  Counsel's 
investigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information  about the June 9,  2016 Trump Tower 
meeting between  Russians  and  senior campaign officials;  efforts  to  have  the  Attorney General 
unrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses. 

We summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory 
obstruction-of-justice elements:  obstructive act, nexus to a  proceeding, and intent.  We focus on 
elements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has "jurisdiction .. . to investigate ... federal 
crimes  committed  in  the  course  of,  and  with  intent  to  interfere  with,  the  Special  Counsel ' s 
investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of 
witnesses."  28  C.F.R.  §  600.4(a).  Consistent  with  our  jurisdiction  to  investigate  federal 
obstruction crimes,  we  gathered  evidence  that  is  relevant  to  the  elements  of those  crimes  and 
analyzed  them  within  an  elements  framework-while  refraining  from  reaching  ultimate 
conclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above.  This section 
also does not address legal  and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the  President; those 
defenses are analyzed in Volume II, Section III, iefra. 

A. 

The Campaign's Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump 

During the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions about a possible connection between 
the Trump Campaign and Russia.7  The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically 
damaging Democratic Party emails that were reported  to  have  been  hacked  by Russia.  Trump 
responded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement 
in  Russia-even though the Trump Organization had pursued a  business project in Russia as late 
as  June 2016.  Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia  had  hacked the emails  at the  same 
time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information 
about any 
further planned WikiLeaks releases.  After the election, when questions persisted about possible 
links  between  Russia  and  the  Trump  Campaign,  the  President-Elect  continued  to  deny  any 
connections  to  Russia  and  privately  expressed  concerns  that  reports  of  Russian  election 
interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.8 

7  This  section  summarizes  and  cites  various  news  stories  not  for  the  truth  of the  information 
contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump's response to those stories in context.  Volume 
I of this report analyzes the  underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media 
during the campaign. 

8  As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals 
with ties to the Russian  government and individuals  associated with the  Trump  Campaign, the evidence 
was  not  sufficient  to  charge  that  any  member  of the  Trump  Campaign  conspired  or  coordinated  with 
representatives ofthe Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

1.  Press Reports Allege Links Between the Trump Campaign and Russia 

On  June  16,  2015,  Donald  J.  Trump  declared  his  intent  to  seek  nomination  as  the 
Republican candidate for President.9  By early 2016, he distinguished himself among Republican 
candidates by speaking of closer ties with Russia, 10 saying he would get along well with Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, 11  questioning whether the NATO alliance was obsolete, 12  and praising 
Putin as a "strong leader."13  The press reported that Russian political analysts and commentators 
perceived Trump as favorable.to Russia.14 

Beginning in February 2016 and continuing through the summer, the media reported that 
several Trump campaign advisors appeared to have ties to Russia.  For example, the press reported 
that campaign advisor Michael Flynn was seated next to Vladimir Putin at an RT gala in Moscow 
in  December 2015  and that Flynn had appeared regularly on RT as an analyst. 15  The press also 
reported that foreign policy advisor Carter Page had ties to a Russian state-run gas company, 16 and 
that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had done work for the "Russian-backed former Ukrainian 
president Viktor Yanukovych."17  In addition,  the  press raised  questions  during the  Republican

2.  The Trump Campaign Reacts to WikiLeaks's Release of Hacked Emails 

On  June  14,  2016,  a  cybersecurity  firm  that  had  conducted  in-house  analysis  for  the 
Democratic  National  Committee  (DNC)  posted  an  announcement  that  Russian  government 
hackers had infiltrated the DNC's computer and obtained access to documents. 19 

On July 22, 2016, the day before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks posted 
thousands of hacked DNC documents revealing sensitive internal deliberations.20  Soon thereafter, 
Hillary Clinton's campaign manager publicly contended that Russia had hacked the DNC emails 
and arranged their release  in  order to  help candidate Trump.21  On July 26, 2016, the New York 
Times reported that U.S. "intelligence agencies ha[d] told the White House they now have 'high 
confidence' that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the 
Democratic National Committee.',22 

Within  the  Trum  Cam  ai  n,  aides  reacted  with  enthusiasm  to  reports  of the  hacks.23 
discussed with Campaign officials that WikiLeaks 
would  release  the  hacked  material. 
Some  witnesses  said  that  Trump  himself discussed  the

3.  The Trump Campaign Reacts to  Allegations That Russia was Seeking to  Aid 

Candidate Trump 

In the days  that followed  WikiLeaks's July 22, 2016 release of hacked DNC emails,  the 
Trump Campaign publicly rejected suggestions that Russia was seeking to aid candidate Trump. 
On July 26, 2016, Trump tweeted that it was "[c]razy" to suggest that Russia was "dealing with 
Trump"32 and that "[f]or the record," he had "ZERO investments in Russia." 33 

In a  press conference the next day,  July 27, 2016,  Trump characterized "this whole thing 
with Russia" as "a total deflection" and stated that it was "farfetched" and "ridiculous."34  Trump 
said that the assertion that Russia had  hacked the emails was unproven,  but stated that it would 
give him "no pause" if Russia had Clinton's emails.35  Trump added, "Russia, if you're listening, 
I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.  I think you will probably be rewarded

do  than  have Russia  friendly  as  opposed  to the  way  they  are  right now,"  and  in  response  to a 
question  about  whether  he  would  recognize  Crimea  as  Russian  territory  and  consider  lifting 
sanctions, Trump replied, "We ' ll  be looking at that.  Yeah, we'll be looking."37 

During  the  press  conference,  Trump  repeated  "I  have  nothing  to do  with  Russia"  five 
times.38  He stated that "the closest [he] came to Russia" was that Russians may have purchased a 
home or condos from  him.39  He said that after he held the Miss Universe pageant in  Moscow in 
2013 he had be.en interested in working with Russian companies that "wanted to put a lot of money 
into developments in Russia" but " it never worked out."40  He explained, "[t]rankly, I didn't want 
to do it for a couple of different reasons.  But we had a major developer ... that wanted to develop 
property in Moscow and other places.  But we decided not to do it."41  The Trump Organization, 
however, had been pursuing a building project in Moscow-the Trump Tower Moscow project(cid:173)
from approximately September 2015 through June 2016, and the candidate was regularly updated 
on developments,  including possible trips by Michael Cohen to Moscow to promote the deal and 
by Trump himself to finalize it.42 

Cohen recalled speaking with Trump after the press conference about Trump's denial of 
any business dealings in Russia, which Cohen regarded as untrue.43  Trump told Cohen that Trump 
Tower Moscow was not a deal yet and said, "Why mention it if it is not a deal?"44  According to

advisors had developed a "party line" that Trump had no business with Russia and no connections 
to Russia.45 

In addition to denying any connections with Russia, the Trump Campaign reacted to reports 
of Russian election interference in aid of the Campaign by seeking to distance itself from  Russian 
contacts.  For example, in August 2016, foreign policy advisor J.D. Gordon declined an invitation 
to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak's residence because the timing was "not optimal" in view 
of media reports about Russian interference.46  On August 19, 2016, Manafort was asked to resign

Russian business.47  And when the media published stories about Page's connections to Russia in 
September 2016, Trump Campaign officials terminated Page's association with the Campaign and 
told the press that he had played "no role" in the Campaign.48 

On  October  7,  2016,  WikiLeaks  released  the  first  set  of emails  stolen  by  a  Russian 
intelligence agency from  Clinton Campaign chairman John Podesta.49  The same day, the federal 
government announced that "the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails 
from  US persons and institutions,  including from  US political organizations." 50  The government 
statement directly linked Russian hacking to the releases on WikiLeaks, with the goal of interfering 
with the presidential election, and concluded "that only Russia' s senior-most officials could have 
authorized these activities" based on their "scope and sensitivity."51 

On  October  11,  2016,  Podesta  stated  publicly  that  the  FBI  was  investigating  Russia's

and responded, "Nothing could be further from the truth."53 

4.  After the  Election,  Trump Continues to Deny  Any  Contacts  or  Connections 

with Russia or That Russia Aided his Election 

On November 8, 2016,  Trump was elected President.  Two  days  later,  Russian  officials 
told the  press that the  Russian  government had  maintained  contacts with Trump' s  "immediate 
entourage" during the campaign.54  In response, Hope Hicks, who had been the Trump Campaign 
spokesperson, said,  "We are  not aware of any campaign representatives that were in  touch  with 
any foreign entities before yesterday, when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders." 55  Hicks 
gave an additional statement denying any contacts between the Campaign and Russia:  "It never 
happened.  There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the 
campaign."56 

On December 10, 2016, the press reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had "concluded 
that  Russia interfered  in  last  month's  presidential  election to boost Donald Trump's bid  for  the 
White House."57  Reacting to the story the next day, President-Elect Trump stated, "I think it's 
ridiculous.  I think  it's just another excuse."58  He  continued that no  one really  knew who was 
responsible for the hacking, suggesting that the intelligence community had "no idea if it's Russia 
or China or somebody.  It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place."59  The President-Elect

also  said that Democrats were "putting D out"  the story of Russian  interference  "because they 
suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics."60 

On  December  18,  2016,  Podesta told  the  press  that  the election  was  "distorted  by  the 
Russian intervention" and questioned whether Trump Campaign officials had been "in touch with 
the Russians."61  The same day,  incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared on Fox News 
Sunday and declined  to  say  whether the  President-Elect accepted  the intelligence  community's 
determination  that  Russia  intervened  in  the  election.62  When  asked  about  any  contact  or 
coordination  between the Campaign and Russia, Priebus said, "Even this question is  insane.  Of 
course we didn't interface with the Russians."63  Priebus added that "this whole thing is a spin job" 
and said, "the real question is, why the Democrats ... are doing everything they can to de legitimize 
the outcome of the election?"64 

On December 29, 2016, the Obama Administration announced that in response to Russian 
cyber  operations aimed  at  the  U.S.  election,  it was  imposing  sanctions and  other  measures  on 
several Russian  individuals and entities.65  When first asked about the sanctions, President-Elect 
Trump said, "I think we ought to get on with our lives."66  He then put out a  statement that said 
"It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,"  but indicated that he would meet 
with intelligence community leaders the following week for a briefing on Russian  interference.67 
The briefing occurred on January 6, 2017.68  Following the briefing, the intelligence community 
released the public version  of its assessment, which concluded with high  confidence that Russia 
had  intervened  in  the  election  through  a  variety  of means  with  the  goal  of harming  Clinton's

electability.69  The assessment further concluded with high confidence that Putin and the Russian 
government had developed a clear preference for Trump.70 

Several days later, BuzzFeed published unverified allegations compiled by former British 
intelligence  officer  Christopher  Steele  during  the  campaign  about  candidate  Trump's Russia 
connections under the headline "These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia."71  In a 
press conference the  next  day,  the President-Elect called the  release "an absolute  disgrace"  and 
said, " I have no dealings with Russia.  I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've 
stayed away . . ..  So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings.  We could make deals 
in Russia very easily ifwe wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict."72 

Several  advisors  recalled  that  the  President-Elect  viewed  stories  about  his  Russian 
connections,  the Russia  investigations,  and  the  intelligence  community  assessment of Russian 
interference as a  threat to the legitimacy of his electoral victory.73  Hicks, for example, said that 
the President-Elect viewed the intelligence community assessment as his "Achilles heel"  because, 
even  if Russia had no impact on  the election, people would think Russia helped him win,  taking 
away  from  what  he  had  accomplished.74  Sean  Spicer,  the  first  White  House  communications 
director,  recalled  that the  President thought the  Russia  story  was  developed  to  undermine  the 
legitimacy of his election.75  Gates said the President viewed the Russia investigation as an attack 
on the  legitimacy of his win.76  And Priebus recalled that when the intelligence assessment came 
out, the President-Elect was concerned people would question the legitimacy of his win .77

B. 

The President's Conduct Concerning the Investigation of Michael Flynn 

Overview 

During the presidential transition, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had 
two phone calls with the Russian Ambassador to the United States about the Russian response to 
U.S.  sanctions  imposed  because  of Russia's  election  interference.  After the  press  reported  on 
Flynn's contacts with the  Russian  Ambassador,  Flynn  lied to  incoming  Administration officials 
by saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls.  The officials publicly repeated those lies in 
press  interviews.  The  FBI,  which  previously  was  investigating  Flynn  for  other  matters, 
interviewed him about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies 
to the FBI.  On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House 
that  Flynn  and  the  Russian  Ambassador  had  discussed  sanctions  and  that  Flynn  had  been 
interviewed by the FBT.  The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James 
Corney in which he asked for Corney's loyalty.  On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn 
to resign.  The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Corney in which 
he said, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go." 

Evidence 

1.  Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with 

Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak 

Shortly  after the  election,  President-Elect Trump  announced  he  would  appoint Michael 
Flynn as his National Security Advisor.78  For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on 
the  Presidential  Transition  Team  (PTT) coordinating policy  positions  and communicating with 
foreign  government  officials,  including  Russian  Ambassador  to  the  United  States  Sergey 
Kislyak.79 

On  December  29,  2016,  as  noted  in  Volume  II,  Section  TT.A.4,  supra,  the  Obama 
Administration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian 
individuals and entities.80  That day,  multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the 
sanctions and the impact they would have on the  incoming Administration, and Flynn informed 
members  of the  PTT that  he  would be  speaking to the  Russian  Ambassador later  in  the day.81

Flynn, who was in  the Dominican Republic at the time, and K.T. McFarland, who was slated to 
become the Deputy National  Security Advisor and was at the Mar-a-Lago resort in  Florida with 
the President-Elect and other senior staff, talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should 
communicate  to  Kislyak  about  the  sanctions.82  McFarland  had  spoken  with  incoming 
Administration officials about the sanctions and Russia' s possible responses and thought she had 
mentioned  in those conversations that Flynn was scheduled to speak with Kislyak.83  Based  on 
those conversations, McFarland informed Flynn that incoming Administration officials at Mar-a(cid:173)
Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.84  At 4:43 p.m. that afternoon, McFarland sent 
an email to several officials about the sanctions and informed the group that "Gen [F]lynn is talking 
to russian ambassador this evening."85 

Approximately one hour later, McFarland met with the President-Elect and senior officials 
and  briefed them  on  the sanctions  and  Russia's possible responses.86  Incoming Chief of Staff 
Reince Priebus recalled that McFarland  may have mentioned  at the  meeting that the  sanctions 
situation could be "cooled down" and not escalated.87  McFarland recalled that at the end of the 
meeting,  someone  may  have  mentioned  to  the  President-Elect that  Flynn  was  speaking to  the 
Russian  Ambassador that evening.88  McFarland  did  not recall  any  response  by  the  President(cid:173)
Elect.89  Priebus recalled that the President-Elect viewed the sanctions as an attempt by the Obama 
Administration to embarrass him by delegitimizing his election.90 

Immediately after discussing the sanctions with McFarland on December 29, 2016, Flynn 
called Kislyak and  requested that Russia  respond  to  the  sanctions  only in  a  reciprocal  manner, 
without escalating the  situation.91  After the  call,  Flynn  briefed  McFarland  on  its substance.92 
Flynn told McFarland that the Russian response  to the sanctions was not going to  be escalatory 
because Russia wanted a  good relationship with the Trump Administration.93  On December 30, 
2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures

in response to the sanctions at that time and would instead "plan ... further steps to restore Russian(cid:173)
US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration."94  Following that announcement, 
the  President-Elect tweeted, "Great move  on  delay  (by V. Putin) - I  always  knew he  was very 
smart!" 95 

On December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him that Flynn ' s request had been 
received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate  in  response to the request.96 
Later that day, Flynn told McFarland about this follow-up conversation with Kislyak and Russia's 
decision  not to escalate the sanctions situation  based on Flynn' s  request.97  McFarland recalled 
that Flynn  thought  his  phone  call  had  made  a  difference.98  Flynn  spoke  with  other  incoming 
Administration officials that day, but does not recall whether they discussed the sanctions.99 

Flynn  recalled  discussing  the  sanctions  issue  with  incoming  Administration  official 
Stephen  Bannon  the  next  day. 10°  Flynn  said  that  Bannon  appeared  to  know  about  Flynn's 
conversations with Kislyak, and he and Bannon agreed that they had "stopped the train on Russia' s 
response" to the  sanctions. 101  On January 3, 2017, Flynn saw the  President-Elect in  person  and 
thought they discussed  the Russian  reaction  to  the  sanctions,  but Flynn  did  not have a  specific 
recollection of telling the President-Elect about the substance of his calls with Kislyak. 102 

Members of the intelligence community were surprised by Russia's decision not to retaliate 
in  response to the sanctions. 103  When analyzing Russia's response, they became aware of Flynn's 
discussion of sanctions with Kislyak. 104  Previously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn 
based on his relationship with the Russian govemment.105  Flynn's contacts with Kislyak became 
a key component of that investigation.106

On  January  6,  2017, as noted  in  Volume  II,  Section 11.A.4,  supra,  intelligence  officials 
briefed President-Elect Trump and the incoming Administration on the intelligence community's 
assessment  that  Russia  had  interfered  in  the  2016  presidential  election. 107  When  the  briefing 
concluded, Corney spoke with the President-Elect privately to brief him on unverified, personally 
sensitive  allegations  compiled  by  Steele.108  According  to  a  memorandum  Corney  drafted 
immediately after their private discussion, the President-Elect began the meeting by telling Corney 
he  had  conducted  himself honorably  over  the  prior  year  and  had  a  great  reputation. 109  The 
President-Elect stated that he thought highly of Corney, looked forward to working with him, and 
hoped that he planned to stay on as FBI director.11° Corney responded that he intended to continue 
serving  in  that  role.111  Corney  then  briefed the  President-Elect on the sensitive material  in  the 
Steele reporting. 112  Corney recalled that the President-Elect seemed defensive, so Corney decided

to  assure  him that the FBI  was  not investigating  him  personally. 113  Corney  recalled he  did  not 
want the President-Elect to think of the conversation as a "J. Edgar Hoover move." 114 

On January  10,  2017,  the media reported that Corney  had  briefed the President-Elect on 
the  Steele  reporting, 115  and BuzzFeed  News published  information  compiled  by  Steele  online, 
stating that the information included "specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations 
of contact between Trump aides  and  Russian  operatives." 116  The  next day,  the President-Elect 
expressed concern to intelligence community leaders about the fact that the information had leaked 
and  asked  whether  they  could  make  public  statements  refuting  the  allegations  in  the  Steele 
reports. 117 

In the following weeks, three Congressional committees opened investigations to examine 
Russia's  interference  in  the  election  and  whether  the  Trump  Campaign  had  colluded  with

that it would conduct a bipartisan inquiry into Russian  interference in the election,  including any 
"links between  Russia and  individuals associated with  political  campaigns."119  On January  25, 
2017, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSC[) announced that it had been 
conducting an investigation into Russian election  interference and possible coordination with the

3.  Flynn  Makes  False  Statements  About  his  Communications  with  Kislyak  to 

Incoming Administration Officials, the Media, and the FBI 

On  January  12,  2017,  a  Washington  Post  columnist  reported  that  Flynn  and  Kislyak 
communicated  on  the  day the  Obama  Administration  announced  the  Russia sanctions. 122  The 
column  questioned  whether  Flynn  had  said  something  to  "undercut  the  U.S.  sanctions"  and 
whether Flynn's communications had violated the letter or spirit of the Logan Act. 123 

President-Elect Trump called Priebus after the story was published and expressed anger 
about it. 124  Priebus  recalled  that the President-Elect asked,  "What the hell  is this all about?" 125 
Priebus called Flynn and told him that the President-Elect was angry about the reporting on Flynn 's 
conversations with Kislyak. 126  Flynn recalled that he  felt  a  lot of pressure  because Priebus had 
spoken to the "boss" and  said Flynn  needed to "kill the  story." 127  Flynn directed  McFarland to 
call the Washington Post columnist and inform him that no discussion of sanctions had occurred. 128 
McFarland recalled that Flynn said words to the effect of, "I want to kill the story." 129  McFarland 
made the call as Flynn had requested although she knew she was providing false information, and 
the Washington Post updated the column to reflect that a  "Trump official" had denied that Flynn 
and Kislyak discussed sanctions. 130 

When  Priebus  and  other  incoming  Administration  officials questioned  Flynn  internally 
about  the  Washington Post column, Flynn  maintained  that he had  not  discussed sanctions with 
Kislyak. 131  Flynn repeated that claim to Vice President-Elect Michael Pence and to incoming press 
secretary  Sean  Spicer. 132  In subsequent  media  interviews  in  mid-January,  Pence,  Priebus, and

Spicer  denied  that  Flynn  and  Kislyak  had  discussed  sanctions,  basing  those  denials  on  their 
conversations with Flynn. 133 

The public statements of incoming Administration officials denying that Flynn and Kislyak 
had discussed sanctions alarmed senior DOJ officials, who were aware that the statements were 
not true. 134  Those officials were concerned that Flynn had lied to his colleagues-who in turn had 
unwittingly misled the American public-creating a  compromise situation for Flynn because the 
Department of Justice assessed that the Russian government could prove Flynn lied. 135  The FBI 
investigative  team also  believed  that  Flynn's  calls with  Kislyak and  subsequent  denials about 
discussing  sanctions  raised  potential  Logan  Act  issues  and were  relevant to  the  FBI's  broader 
Russia investigation. 136 

On  January  20,  2017,  President  Trump  was  inaugurated  and  Flynn  was  sworn  in  as 
National Security Advisor.  On January 23, 2017, Spicer delivered his first press briefing and stated 
that he had spoken with Flynn the  night before,  who confirmed that the calls with Kislyak were 
about topics unrelated to sanctions. 137  Spicer's statements added to the Department of Justice's 
concerns  that Russia  had  leverage over  Flynn  based on  his  lies  and  could  use  that derogatory 
information to compromise him. 138 

On January 24, 2017, Flynn agreed to be interviewed by agents from  the FBI. 139  During 
the interview, which took place at the White House, Flynn falsely stated that he did not ask Kislyak 
to  refrain  from  escalating  the  situation  in  response  to  the  sanctions  on  Russia  imposed  by  the 
Obama  Administration. 140  Flynn  also  falsely  stated  that  he  did  not  remember  a  follow-up 
conversation  in  which  Kislyak stated  that  Russia  had  chosen to moderate  its  response  to  those 
sanctions as a  result of Flynn's request. 141

4.  DOJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Conc_erns About Flynn 

On January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel 
Donald McGahn  and  informed  him  that  she  needed to  discuss  a  sensitive  matter  with  him  in 
person. 142  Later  that  day,  Yates  and  Mary  McCord,  a  senior national  security  official  at  the 
Department of Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel's Office 
attorney James Burnham. 143  Yates  said  that  the  public  statements  made  by the  Vice President 
denying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynn in a  potentially 
compromised position because the Russians would know he had lied. 144  Yates disclosed that Flynn 
had been interviewed by the FBI. 145  She declined to answer a specific question about how Flynn 
had performed during that interview, 146  but she indicated that Flynn' s statements to the FBI were 
similar  to  the  statements  he  had  made  to  Pence  and  Spicer  denying  that  he  had  discussed 
sanctions.147  McGahn came away  from  the  meeting  with  the  impression  that the FBI  had  not 
pinned Flynn down in  lies, 148  but he  asked  John  Eisenberg, who served as  legal advisor to the 
National Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn's FBI interview and 
his contacts with Kislyak. 149 

That afternoon, McGahn notified the President that Yates had come to the White House to 
discuss concerns about Flynn.150  McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President 
asked him to repeat it, so he did. 151  McGahn recalled that when he described the FBI interview of 
Flynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there 
may not have been a clear violation of 18  U.S.C.  §  I 001. 152  The President asked about Section 
1001, and McGahn explained the law to him, and also explained the Logan Act. 153  The President

instructed McGahn to work with Priebus and Bannon to look into the matter further and directed 
that they not discuss  it with any other officials. 154  Priebus recalled that the President was angry 
with Flynn  in  light of what Yates had  told  the  White House  and  said, "not again,  this  guy,  this 
stuff." I 55 

That evening, the President dined with several senior advisors and  asked the group what 
they thought about FBI Director Comey. 156  According to Director of National Intelligence Dan 
Coats, who was at the dinner, no one openly advocated terminating Corney but the consensus on 
him was not positive. 157  Coats told the group that he thought Corney was a good director. 158  Coats 
encouraged the President to meet Corney face-to-face and spend time with him  before making a 
decision about whether to retain him.159

The  next  day,  January  27,  2017,  McGahn  and  Eisenberg  discussed  the  results  of 
Eisenberg's initial  legal research  into Flynn's conduct, and specifically whether Flynn may have 
violated  the Espionage Act,  the Logan  Act,  or  18  U .S.C.  §  1001. 160  Based on  his  prelim inary 
research,  Eisenberg  informed  McGahn  that  there  was  a  possibility  that Flynn  had  violated  18 
U.S.C. § 1001  and the Logan Act. 16 1  Eisenberg noted that the United States had never successfully 
prosecuted an individual  under the Logan Act and  that Flynn could have  possible defenses,  and

7 (President Obama's comment sat with President-Elect Trump more than Hicks expected).  Priebus said 
that the President had become unhappy  with Flynn even before the  story of his calls with Kislyak broke 
and had become so upset with Flynn that he would not look at him  during intelligence briefings.  Priebus 
1/18/18 302, at 8.  Hicks said that the President thought Flynn had bad judgment and was angered by tweets

told McGahn that he  believed it was unlikely that a prosecutor would pursue a Logan Act charge 
under the circumstances. 162 

That same morning, McGahn asked Yates to return to the White House to discuss Flynn 
again. I63  In that second meeting, McGahn expressed doubts that the Department of Justice would 
bring a Logan Act prosecution against Flynn, but stated that the White House did not want to take 
action that would  interfere with  an ongoing FBI  investigation of Flynn. 164  Yates responded that 
Department ofJustice had notified the White House so that it could take action in response to the 
infonnation provided.165  McGahn ended the meeting by asking Yates for access to the underlying 
information the Department of Justice possessed pertaining to Flynn's discussions with Kislyak. 166 

Also on January 27,  the  President called FBI Director Corney and  invited him  to dinner 
that evening.167  Priebus recalled that before the dinner, he told the President something like, "don't 
talk about Russia, whatever you do," and the President promised he would not talk about Russia 
at the dinner.168  McGahn had previously advised the President that he should not communicate 
directly with the Department of Justice to avoid the perception or reality of political  interference 
in  law enforcement. 169  When Bannon learned about the President's planned dinner with Corney, 
he suggested that he or Priebus also attend, but the President stated that he  wanted to dine with 
Corney alone. 17° Corney said that when he arrived for the dinner that evening, he was surprised 
and concerned to see that no one else had been invited. 171

Corney provided an account of the dinner in a contemporaneous memo, an interview with 
this  Office,  and  congressional  testimony.  According  to  Corney's  account  of the  dinner,  the 
President repeatedly  brought up  Corney's  future,  asking  whether  he wanted  to  stay on  as FBI 
director. 172  Because the President had previously said he wanted Corney to stay on as FBI director, 
Corney  interpreted the President's comments  as  an effort to create  a  patronage  relationship  by 
having Corney ask for his job. 173  The President also brought up the Steele reporting that Corney 
had raised in the January 6,  2017 briefing and stated that he was thinking about ordering the FBI 
to  investigate  the  allegations  to prove  they  were false. 174  Corney  responded  that  the  President 
should think carefully about issuing such an  order because it could create a narrative that the FBI 
was  investigating  him  personally,  which  was  incorrect. 175  Later  in  the  dinner,  the  President 
brought up Flynn and said, "the guy has serious judgment issues." 176  Corney did not comment on 
Flynn and the President did not acknowledge any FBI interest in or contact with Flynn. 177 

According to Corney's account, at one point during the dinner the President stated, "I need 
loyalty,  I  expect  loyalty." 178  Corney  did  not  respond  and  the  conversation  moved  on  to  other 
topics,  but the  President  returned  to  the  subject  of Corney' s  job  at the  end  of the  dinner  and 
repeated, "I need  loyalty." 179  Corney responded, "You will always get honesty from  me."180  The

President said,  "That's what I  want,  honest  loyalty." 181  Corney  said,  "You  will  get that  from 
me." 1s2 

After Corney's account of the dinner became public, the President and his advisors disputed 
that he  had asked for Corney's  loyalty.183  The  President also  indicated that he had not  invited 
Corney to dinner, telling a reporter that he thought Corney had "asked for the dinner"  because " he 
wanted  to  stay  on." I84  But substantial  evidence  corroborates  Corney's  account  of the  dinner 
invitation  and  the  request for  loyalty.  The President's  Daily Diary confirms  that the  President 
"extend[ed] a dinner invitation" to Corney on January 27. 185  With respect to the  substance of the 
dinner conversation, Corney documented the President's request for loyalty in a memorandum he 
began drafting the  night of the  dinner; 186  senior FBI  officials recall that Corney told them about 
the  loyalty  request shortly after the dinner occurred;187  and Corney described  the  request while

6.  Flynn's Resignation 

On February 2, 2017, Eisenberg  reviewed the underlying information relating to Flynn's 
calls with Kislyak. 189  Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a  memorandum about criminal statutes 
that  could  apply  to  Flynn 's  conduct,  but  he  did  not  believe  the  White  House  had  enough 
information to  make  a  definitive  recommendation  to  the  President.190  Eisenberg and McGahn 
discussed  that  Eisenberg's  review  of the  underlying  information  confirmed  his  preliminary 
conclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act. I9I  Because White 
House officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however, they could not assess  his 
exposure to prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1001. 192 

The week of February 6,  Flynn had a  one-on-one  conversation with  the President in  the 
Oval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak. I93  Flynn recalled that 
the President was upset and asked him for  information on the conversations. 194  Flynn listed the 
specific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of 
the  dates  he  listed. I95  The  President  asked  Flynn  what  he  and  Kislyak  discussed  and  Flynn 
responded that he might have talked about sanctions.I96 

memorandum  documenting  the  dinner  to  his  senior  leadership  team,  and  McCabe  confirmed  that  the 
memorandum captured what Corney said on the telephone call immediately following the dinner.  McCabe 
8/17/17 302, at 9-10. 

188  There  also  is  evidence  that  corroborates  other  aspects  of the  memoranda  Corney  wrote 
documenting his interactions with the President.  For example, Corney recalled, and his memoranda reflect, 
that he  told the President in  his January 6, 2017  meeting,  and on  phone calls on March  30 and April  11, 
2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally.  On May 8,  2017, during White House 
discussions about firing Corney, the President told Rosenstein and  others that Corney had told  him three 
times that he was not under investigation, including once in person and twice on the phone.  Gauhar-000058

On February 9, 2017, the  Washington Post reported that Flynn discussed sanctions with 
Kislyak the  month  before the President took office. 197  After the publication of that story,  Vice 
President Pence learned of the Department of Justice's notification to the White House about the 
content  of Flynn's  calls. 198  He  and  other  advisors  then  sought  access  to  and  reviewed  the 
underlying  information  about Flynn's contacts  with  Kislyak. 199  FBI  Deputy Director Andrew 
McCabe, who provided the White House officials access to the information and was present when 
they  reviewed  it,  recalled  the officials asking  him  whether Flynn's conduct violated  the Logan 
Act.200  McCabe responded that he did not know, but the FBI was investigating the matter because 
it was a  possibility.201  Based on  the  evidence of Flynn's  contacts with Kislyak,  McGahn  and 
Priebus concluded that Flynn could not have forgotten the details of the discussions of sanctions 
and had instead been  lying about what he discussed with Kislyak.202  Flynn had also told White 
House officials that the FB[ had told him that the FBI was closing out its investigation of him,203 
but  Eisenberg did  not  believe him.204  After  reviewing  the  materials and  speaking with Flynn, 
McGahn and Priebus concluded that Flynn should be terminated and recommended that course of 
action to the President.205 

That weekend, Flynn accompanied the President to Mar-a-Lago.206  Flynn recalled that on 
February 12, 2017, on the return flight to D.C. on Air Force One, the President asked him whether 
he  had  lied to  the Vice President.207  Flynn responded that he  may have forgotten  details of his 
calls, but he did not think he lied.208  The President responded, "Okay.  That's fine.  T got it."209

On February 13, 2017, Priebus told Flynn he had to resign.21° Flynn said he wanted to say 
goodbye to the President, so Priebus brought him to the Oval Office.21 1  Priebus recalled that the 
President  hugged  Flynn,  shook  his  hand,  and  said,  "We'll  give  you  a  good  recommendation. 
You're a good guy·.  We'll take care ofyou."212 

Talking  points  on  the  resignation  prepared  by  the  White  House  Counsel's  Office  and 
distributed  to  the  White  House  communications  team  stated  that  McGahn  had  advised  the 
President that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted, and the President had determined that the issue 
with Flynn was one of trust.213  Spicer told the press the next day that Flynn was forced to resign 
"not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, [where] a level of trust between the President 
and General Flynn had eroded to the point where [the President] felt he had to make a  change."214 

7.  The President Discusses Flynn with FBI Director Corney 

On February  14,  2017, the  day  after Flynn's  resignation, the  President had  lunch  at the 
White House  with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.21 5  According to  Christie,  at one point 
during the lunch the President said, "Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over."216  Christie 
laughed and responded, "No way."2 17  He said, "this Russia thing is far from over" and "[w]e'll be 
here on Valentine's Day 2018 talking about this."2 18  The President said, "[w]hat do you mean? 
Flynn met with the Russians.  That was the problem.  I fired Flynn.  It's over." 219  Christie recalled 
responding  that  based  on  his  experience  both  as  a  prosecutor and  as  someone  who  had  been 
investigated, firing Flynn would not end the  investigation.220  Christie said there was no way to 
make an investigation shorter, but a lot of ways to make it longer.221  The President asked Christie 
what he meant,  and Christie told the President not to talk about the  investigation even  if he was

frustrated  at times.222  Christie  also  told the  President that he would  never be able  to  get rid  of 
Flynn, "like gum on the bottom of your shoe."223 

Towards the end of the lunch, the President brought up Corney and asked if Christie was 
still friendly with him.224  Christie said he was.225  The President told Christie to call Corney and 
tell him that the President "really like[s] him.  Tell him he's part of the team."226  At the end of the 
lunch,  the  President repeated  his  request  that Christie  reach  out to  Comey. 227  Christie had  no 
intention  of complying with  the  President' s  request that he  contact  Comey.228  He thought the 
President's request was "nonsensical"  and Christie did not want to put Corney in  the position of 
having to receive such a phone call.229  Christie thought it would have been uncomfortable to pass 
on that message .230 

At 4 p.m. that afternoon, the President met with Corney, Sessions, and other officials for a 
homeland  security  briefing.231  At  the  end  of the  briefing,  the  President  dismissed  the  other 
attendees and stated that he wanted to speak to Corney alone.232  Sessions and senior advisor to the

about you.  I'll  get the  President  to  send out a  positive  tweet about you  later."  Kushner  looked  at the 
President when  he mentioned the tweet,  and the President nodded his  assent.  Christie  2/13/ 19 302, at 3.

had left the Oval Office, Priebus opened the door, but the President sent him  away.234 

According to Corney's account of the meeting, once they were alone, the President began 
the conversation by saying, "I want to talk about Mike Flynn."235  The President stated that Flynn 
had not done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but had to be terminated because he 
had  misled  the  Vice  President.236  The  conversation  turned  to  the  topic  of leaks  of classified 
information, but the President returned to Flynn, saying "he is a good guy and has been through a 
lot."237  The President stated, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn 
go.  He is a good guy.  I hope you can  let this go."238  Corney agreed that Flynn " is a good guy," 
but did  not commit to ending the  investigation  of Flynn.239  Corney  testified  under oath that  he 
took  the  President's  statement  "as  a  direction"  because  of the  President's  position  and  the 
circumstances of the one-on-one meeting. 240

Shortly  after  meeting  with  the  President,  Corney  began  drafting  a  memorandum 
documenting their conversation.241  Corney also met with his senior leadership team to discuss the 
President's request, and they agreed not to inform FBI officials working on the Flynn case of the 
President's statements so the officials would not be influenced by the request.242  Corney also asked 
for a meeting with Sessions and requested that Sessions not leave Corney alone with the President 
again.243 

8.  The Media Raises Questions About the President's Delay in Terminating Flynn 

After Flynn was forced to resign, the press raised questions about why the President waited 
more than two weeks after the DOJ notification to remove Flynn and whether the President had 
known  about  Flynn's  contacts  with  Kislyak  before  the  DOJ  notification.244  The  press  also 
continued to raise questions about connections  between Russia and the President's campaign.245 
On February  15,  2017,  the President told reporters, "General Flynn is a wonderful  man.  I think 
he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media."246  On February 16, 2017, the President held

other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept 
on for almost three weeks?" and "Did the President instruct [Flynn] to talk about sanctions with the [Russian

a  press conference and said that he removed Flynn because Flynn "didn' t tell the Vice President 
of the United States the facts,  and then he didn't remember.  And that just wasn' t  acceptable to 
me." 247  The President  said  he  did  not direct  Flynn  to  discuss  sanctions with  Kislyak,  but "it 
certainly would have been okay with me if he did.  I would have directed him to do it if I thought 
he wasn't doing it.  I  didn't direct him,  but I  would have directed him because that' s  his job."248 
In listing the reasons for terminating Flynn, the President did not say that Flynn had lied to him.249 
The President also denied  having any  connection to  Russia,  stating,  "I have nothing to do  with 
Russia.  I told you, I  have no deals there.  I  have no anything."250  The President also said he "had 
nothing to do with" WikiLeaks's publication of information hacked from the Clinton campaign.251 

9.  The President Attempts to  Have K.T. McFarland Create a  Witness Statement 

Denying that he Directed Flynn's Discussions with Kislyak 

On February 22, 2017, Priebus and Bannon told McFarland that the President wanted her 
to resign as Deputy National Security Advisor, but they suggested to her that the Administration 
could make her the ambassador to Singapore.252  The next day, the President asked Priebus to have 
McFarland draft an internal email that would confirm that the President did not direct Flynn to call 
the  Russian  Ambassador about sanctions.253  Priebus said he told the  President he  would  only 
direct McFarland to write such a letter if she were comfortable with it.254  Priebus called McFarland 
into his office to convey the President's request that she memorialize in writing that the President 
did not direct Flynn to talk to Kislyak.255  McFarland told Priebus she did not know whether the 
President had directed Flynn to talk to Kislyak about sanctions, and she declined to say yes or no

to  the request.256  Priebus understood  that McFarland was not comfortable with  the  President's 
request, and he recommended that she talk to attorneys in the White House Counsel's Office.257 

McFarland then reached out to  Eisenberg.258  McFarland told him that she had been fired 
from  her job as Deputy National Security Advisor and offered  the ambassadorship  in  Singapore 
but that the President and  Priebus  wanted a  letter from  her denying  that  the  President directed 
Flynn  to  discuss  sanctions  with  Kislyak.259  Eisenberg  advised  McFarland  not  to  write  the 
requested letter.260  As documented by McFarland  in a  contemporaneous "Memorandum for the 
Record"  that she  wrote  because  she was  concerned  by the President's request:  "Eisenberg  . .. 
thought the requested email and letter would be a bad idea- from my side because the email would 
be awkward.  Why would T be emailing Priebus to make a statement for the record?  But it would 
also be a  bad idea for the President because it looked as if my ambassadorial appointment was in 
some way a quid pro quo."261  Later that evening, Priebus stopped by McFarland' s office and told 
her not to write the email and to forget he even mentioned it.262 

Around the same time, the President asked Priebus to reach out to Flynn and let him know 
that the President still cared about him.263  Priebus called Flynn and said that he was checking in 
and that Flynn was an American hero. 264  Priebus thought the President did not want Flynn saying 
bad things about him.265 

On March 31, 2017, following news that Flynn had offered to  testify before the FBI and 
congressional investigators in exchange for immunity, the President tweeted, "Mike Flynn should 
ask for immunity in that this  is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of

message to Flynn telling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong.267 

Analysis 

In  analyzing  the  President's  conduct  related  to  the  Flynn  investigation,  the  following 

evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  According to Corney's account of his February 14, 2017 meeting 
in the Oval Office, the President told him, "I  hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to 
letting Flynn go .... I hope you can let this go."  In analyzing whether these statements constitute 
an obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Corney's account of the interaction is accurate, 
and,  if so, whether the President's statements had  the  tendency to  impede the  administration  of 
justice by shutting down an  inquiry that could  result in  a  grand jury investigation and a  criminal 
charge. 

After Corney's account of the President' s  request to "let[] Flynn go" became public,  the 
President publicly disputed several aspects of the story.  The President told the New York Times 
that he did not "shoo other people out of the room" when he talked to Corney and that he did not 
remember having a  one-on-one conversation with Comey.268  The President also publicly denied 
that he had asked Corney to "let[] Flynn go" or otherwise communicated that Corney should drop 
the investigation ofFlynn.269  In private, the President denied aspects of Corney's account to White 
House advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Corney 
and stated that Flynn was a good guy.270  Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates 
Corney's account.

302, at 12. 

269  In  a statement on May  16,  2017,  the  White House  said:  "While the President has repeatedly 
expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President 
has never asked Mr. Corney or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving 
General Flynn .... This is  not a  truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President 
and Mr. Corney."  See  Michael  S.  Schmidt,  Camey Memorandum  Says  Trump  Asked Him  to  End Flynn

270  Priebus recalled that the President acknowledged telling Corney that Flynn was a good guy and 
he  hoped  "everything  worked  out for  him."  Priebus  I 0/13/17  302,  at  19.  McGahn  recalled  that  the 
President denied saying to Corney that he hoped Corney would let Flynn go, but added that he was "allowed 
to hope."  The President told McGahn he did not think he had crossed any lines.  McGahn 12/14/ 17 302, at

U.S. Department of Justice 

First,  Corney  wrote a  detailed  memorandum  of his  encounter with  the  President on  the 
same day it occurred.  Corney also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President 
that day, and their recollections of what Corney told them at the time are consistent with Corney's 
account.271 

Second, Corney provided testimony about the President's request that he " let[]  Flynn go" 
under  oath  in  congressional  proceedings  and  in  interviews  with  federal  investigators  subject to 
penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. § I 00 l .  Corney's recollections of the encounter have remained 
consistent over time. 

Third, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to 
occur support Corney's description  of the event.  Corney recalled that the  President cleared the 
room  to  speak with  Corney  alone  after  a  homeland  security  briefing  in  the  Oval  Office,  that 
Kushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly 
opened  the  door  during  the  meeting,  prompting  the  President  to  wave  him  away.  While  the 
President has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have 
confirmed Corney's account of how he ended up in  a  one-on-one meeting with the  President.272 
And the President acknowledged to Priebus  and McGahn that he in  fact spoke to Corney about 
Flynn in their one-on-one meeting. 

Fourth, the President's decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the Attorney 
General  from  the  meeting signals  that the  President wanted to  be  alone  with  Corney,  which  is 
consistent  with  the  delivery  of a  message  of the  type  that Corney  recalls,  rather  than  a  more 
innocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General. 

Finally,  Corney's reaction  to  the  President's statements  is  consistent with the  President 
having asked him to "let[] Flynn go."  Corney met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to 
keep  the President' s  statements  closely  held  and  not to  inform  the team  working on the  Flynn 
investigation so that they would not be influenced by the President' s request.  Corney also promptly 
met with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account 
verified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney 
General's chief of staff. 

A second question is whether the President's statements, which were not phrased as a direct 
order to  Corney,  could  impede  or  interfere  with  the  FBI's  investigation  of Flynn.  While  the 
President said he "hope[d]" Corney could "let[] Flynn go," rather than affirmatively directing him 
to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Corney to close 
the FBl's investigation into Flynn.  First, the President arranged the meeting with Corney so that 
they  would  be  alone  and  purposely  excluded  the  Attorney  General,  which  suggests  that  the 
President meant to make a  request to Corney  that he  did not want anyone else to  hear.  Second, 
because  the  President  is  the  head  of the  Executive  Branch,  when  he  says  that  he  "hopes"  a 
subordinate will  do something,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect that the subordinate will  do  what the 
President wants.  Indeed, the President repeated a version of"let this go" three times, and Corney

U.S. Department of Justice 

testified that he understood the President's statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the 
way Corney reacted at the time. 

b. 

Nexus to a proceeding.  To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary 
to  show  that  the  President  could  reasonably  foresee  and  actually  contemplated  that  the 
investigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution. 

At the time of the President's one-on-one meeting with Corney, no grand jury subpoenas 
had been issued as part of the FBI's investi  ation into Fl  nn.  But Fl  nn's lies to the FBI violated 
federal  criminal  law, 
,  and  resulted  in  Flynn's 
prosecution  for  violating  18  U .S.C.  §  100 I.  By the  time  the President spoke to  Corney  about 
Flynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn' s statements 
to senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had 
told  the  same version  of events to  the FBI.  McGahn also  informed the President that  Flynn' s 
conduct could violate 18 U.S.C. §  l 001.  After the Vice President and senior White House officials 
reviewed the underlying information  about Flynn's calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that 
Flynn could not have forgotten  his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had  been 
lying.  In addition, the President's instruction to the FBI Director to "let[] Flynn go" suggests his 
awareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution. 

c. 

Intent.  As  part  of our investigation,  we examined  whether the President had  a 
personal stake in the outcome of an investigation  into Flynn-for example, whether the President 
was aware of Flynn' s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that 
the President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been 
passed on to the public.  Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and 
content of Flynn's calls when they occurred,  but the  evidence is  inconclusive and could  not be 
relied upon to establish the President's knowledge.  In advance of Flynn's initial call with Kislyak, 
the  President attended a  meeting where  the  sanctions  were  discussed  and  an  advisor may have 
mentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak.  Flynn told McFarland about the substance 
of his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia's response, and Flynn 
recalled talking to Bannon in  early January 2017  about how they had successfully "stopped the 
train  on  Russia's response"  to the  sanctions.  It would have been  reasonable for  Flynn  to  have 
wanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his 
request had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate 
in  response  to the  request,  and  the  President was pleased by the Russian  response,  calling  it a 
"[g]reat  move."  And  the President never said  publicly or internally that Flynn  had  lied to  him 
about the calls with Kislyak. 

But McFarland  did  not recall  providing the President-Elect with Flynn's read-out of his 
calls with Kislyak,  and Flynn does  not have a  specific recollection  of telling the President-Elect 
directly about the calls.  Bannon  also said  he did  not recall hearing about the calls from  Flynn. 
And in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed on the calls and whether he 
had  lied  to  the  Vice  President,  suggesting  that  he  did  not  already  know.  Our  investigation 
accordingly  did  not  produce  evidence  that  established  that the  President  knew  about  Flynn ' s 
discussions  of sanctions  before  the  Department  of Justice  notified  the  White  House  of those 
discussions  in  late  January  2017.  The  evidence  also  does  not  establish  that  Flynn  otherwise

possessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive 
to end the FBI' s inquiry into Flynn' s conduct. 

Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI's 
broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would 
end "the whole Russia thing."  Flynn's firing  occurred at a  time  when the  media and  Congress 
were  raising  questions  about Russia's  interference  in  the  election  and whether members of the 
President's campaign  had  colluded with  Russia.  Multiple  witnesses  recalled  that the  President 
viewed the Russia investigations as a  challenge to the legitimacy of his election.  The President 
paid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when 
the  story  broke  disclosing  that Flynn  had  discussed  sanctions  with  Kislyak.  Just  hours  before 
meeting one-on-one with Corney, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to 
the Russia inquiries.  And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would 
not end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach  out to Corney and convey 
that the President liked him and he was part of "the team."  That afternoon, the President cleared 
the room and asked Corney to "let[] Flynn go." 

We also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President' s direction to Corney 
In  public  statements  the  President  repeatedly

described  Flynn  as  a  good  person  who  had  been  harmed  by the  Russia  investigation,  and the 
President  directed  advisors  to  reach  out  to  Flynn  to 
tell  him  the  President  "care[d]" 
about  him and felt bad for him.  At  the  same time,  multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, 
Priebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was 
forced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn.  Priebus said he believed 
the President's initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard, but from concern 
about the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early 
in  the  Administration.  And  Priebus  indicated  that  the  President's  post-firing  expressions  of 
support for  Flynn  were  motivated  by the President's desire to  keep Flynn  from  saying negative 
things about him. 

The way  in  which the  President communicated the  request to Corney also  is  relevant to 
understanding the President's intent.  When the President first learned about the FBI investigation 
into Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the 
White House.  The next day,  the  President  invited  Corney  for a  one-on-one dinner against the 
advice of an aide who recommended that other White House officials also attend.  At the dinner, 
the President asked Corney for " loyalty" and, at a different point in  the conversation, mentioned 
that Flynn  had judgment  issues.  When  the  President  met  with  Corney  the  day  after Flynn's 
termination-
shortly  after  being  told  by  Christie  that  firing  Flynn  would  not  end  the  Russia 
investigation-the President cleared  the room,  even excluding the Attorney General,  so  that he 
could again speak to Corney alone.  The President's decision  to  meet one-on-one with  Corney 
contravened the advice of the  White  House Counsel that the President should not communicate 
directly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement 
activities.  And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Corney to " let[] Flynn 
go"- a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise 
of prosecutorial discretion.

Finally, the President's effort to have McFarland write an  internal email denying that the 
President had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President' s  concern 
about being associated with Flynn's conduct.  The evidence does not establish that the President 
was  trying to  have  McFarland  lie.  The President's request,  however, was sufficiently irregular 
that McFarland-who did not know the full  extent of Flynn' s communications with the President 
and thus could not make the representation the President wanted-felt the need to draft an internal 
memorandum documenting the President's request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request 
would look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship. 

C. 

The  President's  Reaction  to  Public  Confirmation  of  the  FBl's  Russia 
Investigation 

Overview 

In early March  2017, the President learned  that  Sessions was considering rec using  from 
the Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal.  After Sessions announced his recusal on 
March  2,  the  President expressed  anger  at  Sessions  for  the  decision  and  then  privately  asked 
Sessions to "unrecuse."  On March 20, 2017, Corney publicly disclosed the existence of the FBI's 
Russia  investigation. 
In  the  days  that  followed,  the  President  contacted  Corney  and  other 
intelligence  agency  leaders  and  asked  them  to  push  back  publicly  on  the  suggestion  that  the 
President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to "lift the cloud" 
of the ongoing investigation. 

Evidence 

1 .  Attorney General Sessions Recuses From the Russia Investigation 

Tn  late  February  2017,  the  Department  of Justice  began  an  internal  analysis  of whether 
Sessions  should  recuse  from  the  Russia  investigation  based  on  his  role  in  the  2016  Trump 
Campaign.273  On March  I, 2017, the press reported that,  in  his January confirmation hearing to 
become Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian 
Ambassador Kislyak before the presidential election,  leading to  congressional calls for Sessions 
to recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia's interference in the presidential election.274 

Also on March  I, the President called Corney and said he wanted to check in and see how 
Corney was doing.275  According to an email Corney sent to his  chief of staff after the  call, the 
President "talked about Sessions a bit," said that he had heard Corney was "doing great," and said 
that he  hoped  Corney would  come by  to say hello when  he was at the  White House.276  Corney

interpreted the call as an effort by the President to "pull [him]  in," but he did not perceive the call 
as an attempt by the President to find out what Corney was doing with the Flynn investigation.277 

The next morning, the President called McGahn and  urged him to contact Sessions to tell 
him not to recuse himself  from  the Russia investigation.278  McGahn understood the President to 
be  concerned  that  a  recusal  would  make  Sessions  look  guilty  for  omitting  details  in  his 
confirmation hearing; leave the President unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the 
presidency  and  derail  his  policy  objectives;  and  detract  from  favorable  press  coverage  of a 
Presidential  Address  to  Congress the  President  had  delivered  earlier  in the week.279  McGahn 
reached  out to  Sessions and  reported  that  the  President  was  not  happy  about  the  possibility of 
recusal.280  Sessions replied that he intended to follow the rules on recusal.281  McGahn reported 
back to the President about the call with Sessions, and the President reiterated that he did not want 
Sessions to recuse.282  Throughout the day, McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to 
avert Sessions's recusal by speaking to Sessions's personal counsel, Sessions's chief of staff, and 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times.283 
Sessions recalled  that other White  House advisors also  called him that day to argue against his 
recusal. 284 

That afternoon,  Sessions announced his  decision  to  recuse "from  any existing or future 
investigations  of any matters  related  in  any  way to  the  campaigns  for President of the  United 
States."285  Sessions  believed  the  decision  to  recuse  was  not  a  close call,  given  the  applicable 

of James B. Corney, former Director of the FBI) ("[H]e called me one day .... [H]e just called to check in 
and tell me I was doing an awesome job, and wanted to see how I was doing.").

language in  the Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR),  which  Sessions considered to be clear and 
decisive.286  Sessions  thought that any argument  that the  CFR did  not apply  to  him  was "very 
thin."287  Sessions got the impression, based on calls he received from  White House officials, that 
the  President  was  very  upset  with  him  and  did  not  think  he  had  done  his  duty  as  Attorney 
General.288 

Shortly after Sessions announced his recusal, the White House Counsel's Office directed 
that Sessions should not be contacted about the matter.289  Internal White House Counsel's Office 
notes from March 2, 2017, state "No contact w/Sessions" and "No comms / Serious concerns about 
obstruction."290 

On March 3, the day after Sessions's recusal, McGahn was called into the Oval Office.291 
Other  advisors  were  there,  including  Priebus  and  Bannon.292  The  President  opened  the 
conversation  by saying, "I don't have a  lawyer."293  The President expressed  anger at McGahn 
about the  recusal  and  brought up  Roy Cohn,  stating  that  he  wished Cohn  was  his  attorney.294

290  SC_AD_00123  (Donaldson 3/2/17 Notes).  McGahn  said  he  believed the  note  "No comms / 
Serious concerns  about  obstruction"  may  have  referred  to  concerns McGahn  had  about  the press  team 
saying  "crazy  things"  and  trying  to  spin  Sessions's  recusal  in  a  way  that  would  raise  concerns  about

President whereas McGahn would not.295  The President wanted McGahn to talk to Sessions about 
the recusal, but McGahn told the President that DOJ ethics officials had weighed in on Sessions's 
decision to recuse.296  The President then brought up former Attorneys General Robert Kennedy 
and Eric Holder and said that they  had protected their presidents.297  The President also pushed 
back on the DOJ contacts policy, and said words to the effect of, "You're telling me that Bobby 
and Jack didn't talk about investigations?  Or Obama didn't tell Eric Holder who to investigate?"298 
Bannon recalled that the President was as mad as Bannon had ever seen him and that he screamed 
at McGahn about how weak Sessions was.299  Bannon recalled telling the President that Sessions's 
recusal was not a surprise and that before the inauguration they had discussed that Sessions would 
have  to  recuse  from  campaign-related  investigations  because  of  his  work  on  the  Trump 
Campaign.300 

That weekend,  Sessions and  McGahn  flew to  Mar-a-Lago to  meet with the President.30 1 
Sessions  recalled  that the  President pulled  him  aside to speak to  him  alone  and  suggested that 
Sessions should "unrecuse" from the Russia  investigation.302  The President contrasted Sessions 
with Attorneys General Holder and Kennedy, who had developed a strategy to help their presidents 
where Sessions had not.303  Sessions said he had the impression that the President feared that the 
investigation could spin out of control and disrupt his ability to govern, which Sessions could have 
helped avert if he were still overseeing it.304 

On  March  5,  2017,  the  White House Counsel's Office was  informed  that the FBI  was 
asking for transition-period  records  relating to  Flynn-indicating that the  FBI was  still  actively 
investigating him.305  On March 6, the President told advisors he wanted to call the Acting Attorney

as Attorneys General who protected the presidents they served.  The President thought Holder always stood 
up for  President Obama and  even took a contempt charge for  him, and Robert Kennedy  always  had his 
brother's back.  Bannon 2/14/18 302, at 5.  Priebus recalled that the President said  he  had  been told his 
entire life he  needed to have a great lawyer, a "bulldog," and added that Holder had been willing to take a 
contempt-of-Congress charge for President Obama.  Priebus 4/3/18 302, at 5.

On March 9,  2017, Corney  briefed  the  "Gang of Eight" congressional  leaders  about  the 
FBI's  investigation  of Russian  interference,  including  an  identification  of the  principal  U.S. 
subjects of the investigation.307  Although it is unclear whether the President knew of that briefing 
at the time, notes taken by Annie  Donaldson, then McGahn' s  chief of staff, on March  12, 2017, 
state, "POTUS  in  panic/chaos ... Need binders to put in  front of POTUS.  (1) All things related 
to Russia."308  The week after Corney's briefing, the White House Counsel's Office was in contact 
with SSCI Chairman  Senator Richard  Burr about the Russia  investigations and appears  to  have 
received information about the status of the FBI investigation.309 

On  March  20,  2017,  Corney  was scheduled  to  testify  before  HPSCI.31 0 

In  advance of 
Corney's  testimony,  congressional  officials  made  clear  that  they  wanted  Corney  to  provide 
information about the ongoing FBI investigation.311  Dana Boente, who at that time was the Acting 
Attorney General for the Russia investigation, authorized Corney to confirm the existence of the 
Russia investigation and agreed that Corney should decline to comment on whether any particular 
individuals, including the President, were being investigated.312

were identified in notes taken by Donaldson as "Flynn (FBI was ~oo k ing  for phone

FBI, the Department of Justice, and Corney; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the 
FBI for  Corney's briefing to  the  Gang of8 on March 9.  See SNS-Classified-0000140-44 (3/8/17 Email,

U.S. Department of Justice 

In his opening remarks at the HPSCI hearing, which were drafted in consultation with the 
Department of Justice, Corney stated that he had "been authorized by the Department of Justice to 
confirm  that  the  FBI,  as  part  of [its]  counterintelligence mission,  is  investigating the  Russian 
government's efforts to  interfere in  the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating 
the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian 
government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's effot1s. 
As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any 
crimes were committed."313  Corney added  that he would not comment further on what the FBI 
was "doing and whose conduct [it]  [was]  examining" because the investigation was ongoing and 
classified- but he  observed  that  he  had  "taken  the  extraordinary  step  in  consultation  with  the 
Department of Justice of briefing this Congress's leaders ... in a classified setting in  detail about 
the  investigation."314  Corney  was  specifically  asked  whether  President  Trump  was  "under 
investigation during the campaign" or "under investigation now."315  Corney declined to answer, 
stating, "Please don't over  interpret what I've said as-as the chair and ranking know,  we have 
briefed him  in  great detail on the subjects of the investigation and what we're doing, but I'm not 
gonna answer  about  anybody  in  this  forum."316  Corney was  also  asked  whether the  FBI  was 
investigating the information contained in the Steele reporting, and he declined to answer.317 

According to McGahn and Donaldson, the President had expressed frustration with Corney 
before  his  March  20 testimony,  and  the  testimony  made  matters  worse.318  The  President had 
previously criticized Corney for too frequently making headlines and for not attending intelligence 
briefings at the White House, and the President suspected Corney of leaking certain  information 
to the media.319  McGahn said the President thought Corney was acting like "his own branch of 
government."320

Press  reports  following  Corney's  March  20  testimony  suggested  that  the  FBI  was 
investigating the President, contrary to what Corney had told the President at the end of the January 
6,  2017  intelligence  assessment  briefing.321  McGahn,  Donaldson,  and  senior advisor  Stephen 
Miller recalled that the President was upset with Corney's testimony and the press coverage that 
followed because of the suggestion that the President was under investigation.322  Notes from the 
White  House  Counsel's  Office  dated March  21,  2017,  indicate  that  the  President was  " beside 
himself' over Corney's testimony.323  The President called McGahn repeatedly that day to ask him 
to intervene with the Department of Justice, and, according to the notes, the President was "getting 
hotter and hotter, get rid?"324  Officials in the White House Counsel 's Office became so concerned 
that  the  President  would  fire  Corney  that they  began  drafting  a  memorandum  that  examined 
whether the President needed cause to terminate the FBI director.325 

At the President's urging, McGahn contacted Boente several times on March 21, 2017, to 
seek Boente's assistance in  having Corney or the Department of Justice correct the misperception 
that the President was under investigation.326  Boente did not specifically recall the conversations, 
although he did remember one conversation with McGahn around this time where McGahn asked 
if there was a way to speed up or end the Russia investigation as quickly as possible. 327  Boente 
said McGahn told him the President was under a  cloud and it made it hard for him to govern.328 
Boente  recalled  telling  McGahn  that  there  was  no  good way  to  shorten  the  investigation  and 
attempting  to  do  so  could  erode  confidence  in the  investigation' s  conclusions.329  Boente  said 
McGahn agreed and dropped the issue.330  The President also sought to speak with Boente directly, 
but McGahn told the President that Boente did not want to talk to the President about the request

to intervene with Comey.331  McGahn recalled Boente telling him in  calls that day that he did not 
think  it  was  sustainable  for  Corney  to  stay  on  as  FBI  director  for  the  next  four  years,  which 
McGahn said he conveyed to the President.332  Boente did not recall discussing with McGahn or 
anyone else the idea that Corney should not continue as FBI director.333 

3.  The  President  Asks  Intelligence  Community  Leaders  to  Make  Public 

Statements that he had No Connection to Russia 

In the weeks following Corney's March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly asked 
intelligence community officials to  push back publicly on any suggestion that the President had a 
connection to the Russian election-interference effort. 

On March 22, 2017, the President asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and 
CIA  Director  Michael  Pompeo  to  stay  behind  in  the  Oval  Office  after  a  Presidential  Daily 
Briefing.334  According to Coats, the President asked them whether they could say publicly that no 
link existed between him and Russia.335  Coats responded that the Office of the Director ofNational 
Intelligence (ODNJ) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public 
statement on the Russia investigation.336  Pompeo had no recollection of being asked to stay behind 
after the March 22 briefing, but he recalled that the President regularly urged officials to get the 
word out that he had not done anything wrong related to Russia.337 

Coats told this Office that the President never asked him to speak to Corney about the FBI 
investigation. 338  Some  ODNI  staffers,  however,  had  a  different  recollection  of how  Coats 
described the meeting immediately after it occurred.  According to senior ODNI official Michael 
Dempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the  President had brought up the Russia investigation 
and asked him to contact Corney to see if there was a way to get past the investigation, get it over 
with,  end  it,  or  words  to  that  effect.339  Dempsey  said  that  Coats  described  the  President's 
comments  as  falling  "somewhere  between  musing about  hating  the  investigation"  and  wanting 
Coats to "do something to stop it."340  Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get 
involved with an  ongoing FBI investigation.341  Edward Gistaro, another ODNI official, recalled

that right after Coats's meeting with the President, on the walk from  the Oval Office back to the 
Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Coats said that the President had kept him behind to ask 
him what he could do to  "help with  the  investigation."342  Another ODNI staffer who had been 
waiting for Coats outside the Oval Office talked to Gistaro a few minutes later and recalled Gistaro 
reporting that Coats was upset because the President had asked him to contact Corney to convince 
him there was nothing to the Russia investigation.343 

On Saturday, March 25, 2017, three days after the meeting in the Oval Office, the President 
called Coats and again complained about the Russia investigations, saying words to the effect of, 
" I can't do anything with  Russia, there's things I'd like to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, 
they're all over me with this."344  Coats told the President that the investigations were going to go 
on  and  the  best  thing  to  do  was  to  let  them  run  their  course.345  Coats  later  testified  in  a 
congressional  hearing that he  had "never felt  pressure  to  intervene  or  interfere in  any way  and 
shape-with  shaping  intelligence  in  a  political  way,  or  in  relationship  .
.  to  an  ongoing 
investigation." 346 

.

On  March  26,  2017,  the day after the President  called  Coats, the  President called NSA 
Director  Admiral  Michael  Rogers.347  The  President  expressed  frustration  with  the  Russia 
investigation,  saying  that  it  made  relations  with  the  Russians  difficult.348  The President  told 
Rogers "the thing with the Russians [ wa]s messing up" his ability to get things done with Russia.349 
The  President also  said  that  the  news stories  linking  him  with  Russia were  not true  and asked 
Rogers  if he  could  do  anything  to  refute  the  stories.350  Deputy Director of the  NSA  Richard 
Ledgett, who was present for the call, said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40 
years of government service.351  After the call  concluded, Ledgett prepared a  memorandum  that 
he  and  Rogers  both  signed  documenting  the  content  of the  conversation  and  the  President's 
request, and they placed the memorandum in a safe.352  But Rogers did not perceive the President's 
request  to  be  an  order,  and  the  President  did  not  ask  Rogers  to  push  back  on  the  Russia

investigation  itself.353  Rogers  later testified  in  a congressional hearing that as NSA Director he 
had  "never  been  directed  to  do  anything  [he]  believe[d]  to  be  illegal,  immoral,  unethical  or 
inappropriate" and did "not recall ever feeling pressured to do so."354 

In addition  to  the  specific comments made to Coats, Pompeo,  and Rogers, the  President 
spoke  on  other occasions  in  the  presence of intelligence community  officials  about the Russia 
investigation and stated that it interfered with his ability to conduct foreign relations. 355  On at least 
two  occasions,  the  President  began  Presidential  Daily  Briefings  by  stating  that there  was  no 
collusion with Russia and he hoped a  press statement to that effect could be issued.356  Pompeo 
recalled that the President vented about the investigation on multiple occasions, complaining that 
there was no evidence against him and that nobody would publicly defend him.357  Rogers recalled 
a  private conversation with  the President in  which he " vent[ ed]" about the  investigation, said he 
had done nothing wrong, and said something like the "Russia thing has got to go away."358  Coats 
recalled the President bringing up the Russia investigation several times, and Coats said he finally 
told  the  President  that  Coats's  job  was  to_ provide  intelligence  and  not  get  involved  in 
investigations. 359 

4.  The  President  Asks  Corney  to  "Lift  the  Cloud"  Created  by  the  Russia

On the morning of March 30, 2017, the President reached out to Corney directly about the 
Russia investigation.360  According to Corney's contemporaneous record of the conversation, the 
President said "he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making

that difficult."361  The President asked Corney what could be done to " lift the cloud."362  Corney 
explained  "that we  were  running  it  down  as  quickly as  possible  and that there  would  be  great 
benefit,  if we didn't find anything, to our Good Housekeeping seal of approval, but we had to do 
our work."363  Corney also told the President that congressional leaders were aware that the FBI 
was not investigating the President personally.364  The President said several times, "We need to 
get that fact out."365  The President commented that if there was "some satellite" (which Corney 
took to mean an associate  of the President's or the  campaign) that did something,  "it would be 
good  to  find  that out" but that he himself had  not  done  anything  wrong and  he  hoped  Corney 
"would find  a way to get out that we weren't investigating hirn."366  After the call ended, Corney 
called Boente and told him about the conversation, asked for guidance on how to respond, and said 
he was uncomfortable with direct contact from the President about the investigation.367 

On  the  morning of April  11,  2017,  the  President called  Corney again.368  According  to 
Corney's contemporaneous record of the conversation, the President said he was "following up to 
see if[Corney] did what [the President] had asked last time-getting out that he personally is not 
under investigation."369  Corney responded that he had passed the request to Boente but not heard 
back,  and  he  informed the President that the  traditional  channel for such  a  request would  be  to

have the White House Counsel contact DOJ leadership.370  The President said he would take that 
step.371  The President then ~dded, "Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that 
thing, you know." 372  In a televised interview that was taped early that afternoon, the President was 
asked if it was too late for him to ask Corney to step down; the President responded, "No, it's not 
too late, but you know, I have confidence in him.  We' ll  see what happens.  You know, it's going 
to  be  interesting."373  After the  interview,  Hicks  told  the  President she thought the  President's 
comment about Corney should be removed from the broadcast of the interview, but the President 
wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was unusual.374 

Later that day, the President told senior advisors,  including McGahn and Priebus, that he 
had reached  out to  Corney twice in recent weeks.375  The President acknowledged that McGahn 
would  not  approve  of the  outreach  to  Corney  because  McGahn  had  previously  cautioned  the 
President that he should not talk to Corney directly to prevent any perception that the White House 
was interfering with investigations. 376  The President told McGahn that Corney had indicated the 
FBI could make a public statement that the President was not under investigation if the Department 
of Justice approved that action.377  After speaking with the President, McGahn followed up with 
Boente to relay the President's understanding that the FBI could make a public announcement if 
the  Department of Justice cleared  it.378  McGahn recalled  that Boente said Corney had told him 
there  was  nothing  obstructive  about  the  calls  from  the  President,  but  they  made  Corney 
uncomfortable.379  According  to  McGahn,  Boente  responded  that  he  did  not  want  to  issue  a 
statement  about  the  President  not  being  under  investigation  because  of the  potential  political 
ramifications  and  did  not want to  order Corney  to  do  it  because  that action  could  prompt the

appointment of a  Special Counsel.380  Boente did not recall  that aspect of his conversation with 
McGahn,  but did  recall telling McGahn that the direct outreaches  from  the President to Corney 
were a  problem. 381  Boente recalled that McGahn agreed and said he would do what he could to 
address that issue.382 

Analysis 

In  analyzing  the President's reaction  to  Sessions's  recusal  and  the  requests  he  made  to 
Coats,  Pompeo,  Rogers,  and  Corney,  the  following  evidence  is  relevant  to  the  elements  of 
obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive  act.  The  evidence  shows  that,  after  Corney's  March  20,  2017 
testimony, the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBT's 
investigation.  But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches. 
Some ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them  immediately after the March 22 Oval Office 
meeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Corney and "stop"  the investigation.  But 
the first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently.  Pompeo had no 
memory of the  specific  meeting,  but generally recalled  the  President urging officials to  get the 
word out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia.  Coats recalled that the 
President asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but 
did not ask him to speak with Corney or to help end the investigation.  The other outreaches by the 
President during this  period were similar in  nature:  The President asked Rogers if he could do 
anything to  refute the  stories linking the President to Russia,  and  the  President asked Corney to 
make a  public statement that would " lift the cloud"  of the ongoing investigation by making clear 
that the President was not personally under investigation.  These requests, while significant enough 
that Rogers thought it important to  document the encounter in a w ritten memorandum, were not 
interpreted  by  the  officials  who  received  them  as  directives  to  improperly  interfere  with  the 
investigation. 

b. 

Nexus to a  proceeding.  At the time of the President' s outreaches to leaders of the 
intelligence agencies in  late March and early  April  2017,  the FBI's  Russia investigation did not 
yet involve grand jury proceedings.  The outreaches, however, came after and were in response to 
Corney's March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its counterintelligence mission, 
was  conducting  an  investigation  into  Russian  interference  in  the  2016  presidential  election. 
Corney testified that the  investigation  included any links or coordination with  Trump campaign 
officials and would "include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed." 

c. 

Intent.  As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked 
or directed intelligence agency leaders to  stop or interfere with the FBI' s  Russia investigation(cid:173)
and  the  President  affirmatively  told  Corney  that  if " some  satellite"  was  involved  in  Russian 
election  interference "it would be  good to  find  that  out."  But the President's intent in  trying to 
prevent Sessions' s  recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Corney  following

Corney's  public  announcement  of the  FBT's  Russia  investigation,  is  nevertheless  relevant  to 
understanding what motivated the President' s other actions towards the investigation. 

The  evidence  shows  that  the  President  was  focused  on  the  Russia  investigation's 
implications for his presidency- and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under 
investigation or had links to Russia.  In early March, the President attempted to prevent Sessions's 
recusal,  even after being  told  that Sessions was following  DOJ conflict-of-interest rules.  After 
Sessions recused, the White House Counsel's Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions 
about the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President.  The 
President continued to raise the  issue of Sessions's recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he 
pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse.  The President also told advisors that he wanted 
an  Attorney General  who  would  protect him,  the  way he  perceived  Robert  Kennedy  and  Eric 
Holder to have protected their presidents.  The Pr.esident made statements about being able to direct 
the course of criminal investigations, saying words to the effect of, "You're telling me that Bobby 
and Jack didn't talk about investigations?  Or Obama didn't tell Eric Holder who to investigate?" 

After Corney publicly confirmed the existence of the FBT's Russia investigation on March 
20,  2017,  the  President  was  "beside himself'  and expressed anger that  Corney did  not  issue  a 
statement correcting any misperception that the  President himself was  under investigation.  The 
President sought to  speak with  Acting  Attorney  General  Boente directly  and  told  McGahn  to 
contact Boente to request that Corney make a clarifying statement.  The President then asked other 
intelligence  community  leaders  to  make  public  statements  to  refute  the  suggestion  that  the 
President  had  links  to  Russia,  but the leaders told  him  they could  not  publicly  comment on  the 
investigation.  On March  30 and April  I I, against the  advice  of White House advisors who had 
informed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in 
an ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Corney asking him to "lift the 
cloud" of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally 
under investigation. 

Evidence  indicates  that  the  President  was  angered  by  both  the  existence  of the  Russia 
investigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true 
based on Corney's representations.  The President complained to advisors that if people thought 
Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished. 

Other evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia 
investigation on his  ability to govern.  The President complained that the perception that he was 
under investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign  relations,  particularly with Russia. 
The President told Coats he "can't do  anything with Russia," he told Rogers that "the thing with 
the Russians" was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign  affairs,  and  he told Corney that 
"he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult."

Events Leading Up  To and  Surrounding  the  Termination  of FBI  Director 
Corney 

Overview 

Corney  was  scheduled  to  testify  before  Congress on  May  3,  2017.  Leading  up  to  that 
testimony, the President continued to tell advisors that he wanted Corney to make public that the 
President was not under investigation.  At the hearing, Corney declined to answer questions about 
the scope or subjects of the Russia investigation and did not state publicly that the President was 
not under investigation.  Two days later, on May 5,  2017,  the President told close aides  he was 
going to fire Corney, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make public 
that Corney  had  on  three  occasions  informed  the  President that he  was not under investigation. 
The  President  decided  to  fire  Corney  before  receiving  advice  or  a  recommendation  from  the 
Department of Justice,. but he approved an  initial public account of the termination that attributed 
it to a recommendation from the Department of Justice based on Corney's handling of the Clinton 
email investigation.  After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing 
to  his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire Corney regardless of 
the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision. 
The President also told the Russian Foreign Minister, "I just fired the head of the F.B.I.  He was 
crazy, a  real  nut job.  I faced  great pressure because of Russia.  That's taken off .....  I'm  not 
under investigation."

I.  Corney  Testifies  Before  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  and  Declines  to 

Answer Questions About Whether the President is Under Investigation 

On May 3, 2017, Corney was scheduled to testify at an FBI oversight hearing before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee.383  McGahn recalled that in  the week leading up to  the  hearing, the 
President said that it would be the last straw if Corney did not take the opportunity to set the record 
straight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation.384  The President 
had  previously  told McGahn that the perception that the  President was  under  investigation was 
hurting  his  ability  to carry  out  his  presidential  duties  and  deal  with  foreign  leaders.385  At the 
hearing, Corney declined to answer questions about the status of the  Russia investigation, stating 
"[t]he  Department  of Justice  ha[d]  authorized  [him]  to  confirm  that  [the Russia  investigation] 
exists,"  but that  he  was  "not  going to  say  another  word  about  it"  until  the  investigation  was 
completed.386  Corney also  declined to  answer questions about whether investigators  had  "ruled

out anyone in the Trump campaign as potentially a target ofth[ e] criminal investigation," including 
whether the FBI had "ruled out the president of the United States."387 

Corney was also  asked at the hearing about his decision to announce  11  days before the 
presidential election that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation.388  Corney stated 
that it made him "mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election," 
but added that "even in hindsight" he "would make the same decision."389  He later repeated that 
he had no regrets about how he had handled the email investigation and believed he had "done the 
right thing at each turn."390 

In the afternoon following Corney's testimony, the President met with McGahn, Sessions, 
and  Sessions's Chief of Staff Jody Hunt.391  At that meeting,  the  President asked McGahn how 
Corney  had  done  in  his  testimony  and McGahn  relayed  that  Corney  had  declined  to  answer 
questions  about  whether  the President  was  under  investigation.392  The President became  very 
upset and directed his anger at Sessions.393  According to notes written by Hunt, the President said, 
"This  is  terrible  Jeff. 
It's  all  because  you  recused.  AG  is  supposed  to  be  most  important 
appointment.  Kennedy appointed his brother.  Obama appointed Holder.  I appointed you and you 
recused yourself.  You left me on an  island.  I  can't do. anything."3 94  The President said that the 
recusal  was  unfair  and  that  it was  interfering  with  his  ability  to  govern  and  undermining  his 
authority with foreign leaders.395  Sessions responded that he had had no choice but to recuse, and 
it was a mandatory rather than discretionary decision.396  Hunt recalled that Sessions also stated at 

several times during his  testimony.  See  id.  at 26 (explaining that  he was "not going to say another peep 
about [the investigation] until  we' re done"); id.  at 90 (stating that he would not provide any updates about 
the status of investigation "before the matter is concluded").

some  point  during  the  conversation  that  a  new  start  at the  FBI  would  be  appropriate  and  the 
President should consider replacing Corney as FBI director.397  According to  Sessions, when the 
meeting concluded, it was clear that the President was unhappy with Corney, but Sessions did not 
think the President had made the decision to terminate Comey.398 

Bannon recalled that the President brought Corney up with him at least eight times on May 
3  and May 4, 2017 .399  According to Bannon, the  President said the same thing each time:  "He 
told me three times I'm not under investigation.  He's a showboater.  He's a grandstander.  I don't 
know any Russians.  There was no collusion."400  Bannon told the President that he could not fire 
Corney because "that ship had sailed."401  Bannon also told the President that firing Corney was 
not going to stop the investigation, cautioning him that he could fire the FBI director but could not 
fire the FBI.402 

2.  The President Makes the Decision to Terminate Corney 

The  weekend  following  Corney's May  3,  2017 testimony,  the  President traveled  to  his 
resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.403  At a dinner on Friday, May 5, attended by the President and 
various advisors and family members, including Jared Kushner and senior advisor Stephen Miller, 
the President stated that he wanted to remove Corney and had ideas for a  letter that would be used 
to  make  the  announcement.404  The  President dictated  arguments  and specific  language  for  the 
letter, and Miller took notes.405  As  reflected  in  the notes, the President told Miller that the letter 
should  start,  "While  I  greatly  appreciate  you  informing  me  that  I  am  not  under  investigation 
concerning  what  I  have  often  stated  is  a  fabricated  story  on  a  Trump-Russia  relationship  -
pertaining to the 2016 presidential election, please be informed that I, and I believe the American 
public - including Os and Rs - have  lost faith  in  you as Director of the FBT."406  Following the 
dinner,  Miller prepared  a  termination  letter  based on those  notes  and  research  he  conducted to 
support the President's arguments.407  Over the weekend, the President provided several rounds of

edits on the draft letter.408  Miller said  the President was adamant that he not tell  anyone at the 
White House what they were preparing because the President was worried about leaks.409 

In  his discussions with Miller, the President made clear that he wanted the letter to open 
with a  reference to  him  not being under investigation.410  Miller said  he believed that fact  was 
important  to  the  President  to  show that  Corney  was  not  being  terminated  based  on  any  such 
investigation.41 1 According to Miller,  the  President wanted to  establish  as a  factual  matter that 
Corney had  been under a " review period" and did not have assurance from  the President that he 
would be permitted to keep his job.412 

The final version of the termination letter prepared by Miller and the President began in a 
way  that closely  tracked what the  President had  dictated  to Miller at  the  May  5  dinner:  "Dear 
Director Corney, While I greatly appreciate your informing me, on three separate occasions, that 1 
am  not  under investigation concerning the  fabricated  and  politically-motivated  allegations of a 
Trump-Russia relationship with respect to the 2016 Presidential Election, please be informed that 
T,  along with members of both political parties and, most importantly, the American Public, have 
lost faith in you as the Director of the FBI and you are hereby terminated."413  The four-page letter 
went on to  critique Corney's judgment and  conduct,  including  his May  3  testimony  before  the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, his handling of the Clinton email investigation, and his failure to hold 
leakers accountable.414  The letter stated that Corney had "asked [the  President] at dinner shortly 
after inauguration to let [Corney] stay on in the Director's role, and [the President] said that [he] 
would consider it,"  but the President had "concluded that [he] ha[ d] no alternative but to find new 
leadership for the Bureau - a  leader that restores confidence and trust."415 

In the morning of Monday, May 8, 2017, the President met in the Oval Office with senior 
advisors, including McGahn, Priebus, and Miller, and informed them he had decided to terminate 
Comey.416  The President read  aloud the first paragraphs of the termination letter he wrote with

there would be an important discussion on Monday.  S. Miller  I 0/31/17 302, at 7.

Miller  and  conveyed  that  the  decision  had  been  made and  was  not  up  for discussion.417  The 
President told the group that Miller had researched the issue and determined the President had the 
authority  to  terminate Corney  without cause.418  In an  effort to slow down  the decision-making 
process, McGahn told the President that DOJ leadership was currently discussing Corney's status 
and suggested that  White  House Counsel's Office attorneys should talk with  Sessions  and  Rod 
Rosenstein, who had  recently been confirmed as the Deputy Attorney General.41 9  McGahn said 
that previously scheduled meetings with Sessions and Rosenstein that day would be an opportunity 
to find out what they thought about firing  Comey.420 

At noon,  Sessions, Rosenstein, and Hunt met with McGahn and White House Counsel's 
Office attorney Uttam Dhillon at the White House.421  McGahn said that the President had decided 
to  fire  Corney  and  asked  for  Sessions's  and  Rosenstein's  views.422  Sessions  and  Rosenstein 
criticized Corney and did not raise concerns about replacing him.423  McGahn and Dhillon said the 
fact that neither Sessions nor Rosenstein  objected to replacing Corney gave them  peace of mind 
that the  President's  decision  to fire  Corney  was not an  attempt  to  obstruct justice.424  An  Oval 
Office  meeting was scheduled  later that day  so that Sessions  and  Rosenstein could  discuss  the 
issue with the President.425

3 testimony over the weekend and  thought that something was "not right" with Comey.427  The 
President  said  that  Corney  should  be  removed  and  asked  Sessions  and  Rosenstein  for  their 
views.428  Hunt,  who was  in  the  room,  recalled  that  Sessions  responded that  he  had previously 
recommended  that Corney  be  replaced.429  McGahn  and  Dhillon  said  Rosenstein  described  his 
concerns about Corney's handling of the Clinton email investigation.430 

The President then  distributed copies of the termination  letter he  had drafted with Miller, 
and the discussion turned to the mechanics of how to fire Corney and whether the President's letter 
should be  used.43 1  McGahn and Dhillon urged the President to permit Corney to  resign,  but the 
President was adamant that he be ftred.432  The group discussed the possibility that Rosenstein and 
Sessions  could  provide  a  recommendation  in  writing  that  Corney  should  be  removed.433  The 
President agreed and told Rosenstein to draft a memorandum, but said he wanted to receive it first 
thing the next morning.434  Hunt' s notes reflect that the President told Rosenstein to include in his 
recommendation the fact that Corney had refused to confirm that the President was not personally 
under  investigation.435  According  to  notes  taken  by  a  senior  DOJ  official  of  Rosenstein 's 
description  of his  meeting  with  the  President,  the  President  said,  "Put the  Russia  stuff in  the 
memo."436  Rosenstein  responded  that  the  Russia  investigation  was  not  the  basis  of  his 
recommendation,  so  he  did  not  think  Russia  should  be  mentioned.437  The  President  told 
Rosenstein  he  would apprec iate  it  if Rosenstein put it in  his  letter anyway .438  When  Rosenstein

left the meeting,  he  knew that Corney would be terminated, and he told DOJ colleagues that his 
own reasons for replacing Corney were " not [the President's] reasons."439 

On  May  9,  Hunt  delivered  to  the  White  House  a  letter  from  Sessions  recommending 
Corney's removal and a memorandum from Rosenstein, addressed to the Attorney General, titled 
"Restoring Public Confidence in the FBJ."440  McGahn recalled that the President liked the DOJ 
letters and agreed that they should provide the foundation for a new cover letter from the President 
accepting  the  recommendation  to  terminate  Comey.44 1  Notes  taken  by  Donaldson  on  May  9 
reflected the view of the White House Counsel's Office that the President's original termination 
letter should"[ n Jot [seethe] light of day" and that it would be better to offer"[ n ]o other rationales" 
for the  firing than what was in Rosenstein's and Sessions's memoranda.442  The President asked 
Miller to  draft  a  new termination  letter and  directed  Miller to say  in  the  letter that Corney  had 
informed the President three times that he was not under investigation.443  McGahn, Priebus, and 
Dhillon  objected  to  including  that  language,  but  the  President  insisted  that  it  be  included.444 
McGahn, Priebus, and others perceived that language to be the  most important part of the letter to

the President.445  Dhillon made  a  final  pitch to  the President that Corney should be permitted to 
resign, but the President refused.446 

Around  the time the  President's  letter was finalized, Priebus summoned  Spicer and the 
press team to the Oval Office, where they were told that Corney had been terminated for the reasons 
stated in the letters by Rosenstein and Sessions.447  To announce Corney's termination, the White 
House released a statement, which Priebus thought had been dictated by the President.448  In full, 
the statement read: "Today, President Donald J.  Trump informed FBI Director James Corney that 
he  has  been  terminated  and  removed  from  office.  President  Trump  acted  based  on  the  clear 
recommendations  of both  Deputy Attorney  General  Rod Rosenstein  and  Attorney General  Jeff 
Sessions."449 

That evening,  FBI  Deputy  Director Andrew McCabe  was  summoned  to  meet with  the 
President at the White House.450  The President told McCabe that he had fired Corney because of 
the decisions Corney had made in  the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 
The President asked McCabe if he was aware that Corney had told the President three times that 
he was not under investigation.452  The President also asked McCabe whether many people in  the 
FBI  disliked  Corney  and whether McCabe was part of the  "resistance" that  had  disagreed with 
Corney's decisions in the Clinton investigation.453  McCabe told the President that he knew Corney 
had told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt  positively 
about  Corney,  and  that  McCabe  worked  "very  closely"  with  Corney  and  was  part  of all  the 
decisions that had been made in  the Clinton investigation.454

the line that said Corney advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under 
investigation).  According  to  Hunt's  notes,  the  reference  to  Corney's  statement  would  indicate  that 
"notwithstanding"  Corney's  having  informed  the  President  that  he  was  not  under  investigation,  the 
President  was  terminating  Corney.  Hunt-000032  (Hunt  5/9/17  Notes).  McGahn  said  he  believed  the

Later that evening, the President told his communications team  he was unhappy with the 
press  coverage  of Corney's  termination  and  ordered  them  to  go  out and  defend  him.455  The 
President also called Chris Christie and, according to Christie, said he was getting "killed" in  the 
press over Corney 's  termination.456  The President asked what he should do.457  Christie asked, 
"Did you fire  [Corney]  because of what Rod wrote in the memo?", and the President responded, 
"Yes."458  Christie said  that the President should "get Rod out there"  and  have him  defend  the 
decision.459  The President told Christie that this was a  " good idea" and said he was going to call 
Rosenstein right away.460 

That night,  the  White House  Press  Office  called  the  Department of Justice and  said  the 
White House wanted to put out a statement saying that it was Rosenstein's idea to fire Comey.461 
Rosenstein told other DOJ officials that he would  not participate in  putting out a  "false story."462 
The  President  then  called  Rosenstein  directly  and  said  he  was  watching  Fox  News,  that  the 
coverage had been great, and that he wanted Rosenstein to do a  press conference.463  Rosenstein 
responded that this was not a good idea because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that 
Corney's firing was not his idea.464  Sessions also informed the White House Counsel's Office that 
evening that Rosenstein was  upset  that his  memorandum was being po1trayed as the  reason  for 
Corney' s termination.465 

In an unplanned press conference late in the evening of May 9, 2017, Spicer told reporters, 
"It was all [Rosenstein].  No one from the White House.  It was a DOJ decision."466  That evening 
and  the  next morning,  White  House  officials and  spokespeople continued  to  maintain  that  the

President's  decision  to  terminate  Corney  was  driven  by  the  recommendations  the  President 
received from Rosenstein and Sessions.467 

In  the  morning  on  May  10,  2017,  President Trump  met with  Russian  Foreign  Minister 
Sergey  Lavrov  and  Russian  Ambassador  Sergey  Kislyak  in  the  Oval  Office.468  The  media 
subsequently reported that during the May  10 meeting the President brought up his decision the 
prior day to terminate Corney, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: "T just fired  the head of the F.B.I.  He 
was crazy, a real nut job.  I faced great pressure because of Russia.  That's taken off.  ...  I' m  not 
under investigation."469  The President never denied making those statements, and the White House 
did  not  dispute  the  account,  instead  issuing  a  statement  that  said:  "By  grandstanding  and 
politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Corney created unnecessary pressure on 
our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.  The investigation would have always continued, 
and obviously, the termination of Corney would not have ended it.  Once again,  the real  story is 
that our national  security  has  been  undermined  by the  leaking  of private  and highly  classified 
information."470  Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with 
Lavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Corney, "he is crazy."471  When McGahn asked the 
President about his comments  to  Lavrov, the  President said  it was good that Corney  was  fired 
because that took the pressure  off by making  it clear that he was not  under  investigation so  he 
could get more work done.472 

That same morning, on May  10,  2017, the  President called McCabe.473  According to a 
memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the 
White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to

planned on  May 2, 2017, during a  telephone call  between the President and Russian President Vladimir 
Putin, and the meeting date was confirmed on May 5, 2017, the same day the President dictated ideas for

employees.474  The President said he had  received "hundreds" of messages from  FBI employees 
indicating their support for terminating Comey.475  The President also told McCabe that Corney 
should not have been permitted to travel back to Washington, D.C. on the FBI's airplane after he 
had been terminated and that he did not want Corney "in the building again," even to collect his 
belongings.476  When  McCabe  met  with  the  President  that  afternoon,  the  President,  without 
prompting, told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President, estimated that at least 80% of 
the FBI  had voted  for  him,  and  asked  McCabe who  he  had  voted  for  in  the  2016  presidential 
election.477 

· 

In  the  afternoon  of May  10,  2017,  deputy  press  secretary  Sarah  Sanders  spoke  to  the 
President  about  his  decision  to  fire  Corney  and  then  spoke  to  reporters  in  a  televised  press 
conference.478  Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan 
members of Congress had lost confidence in Corney, " [a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of 
the  FBI  had  lost  confidence  in  their  director.  Accordingly,  the  President  accepted  the 
recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Corney from  his position."479 
In  response  to  questions from  reporters,  Sanders  said  that Rosenstein  decided  "on  his own" to 
review Corney's performance and that Rosenstein decided "on his own" to come to the President 
on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Corney.  When a reporter indicated that the "vast 
majority"  of FBI  agents  supported  Corney,  Sanders  said,  "Look,  we've  heard  from  countless 
members of the FBI that say very different things. "48°  Following the press conference, Sanders 
spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any  inaccuracies in 
her comments.481  Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from "countless members 
of the FBI" was a "slip of the tongue."482  She also recalled that her statement in a separate press 
interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had  lost  confidence in  Corney was a  comment she made 
"in the heat of the moment" that was not founded on anything.483 

Also  on  May  I 0,  2017,  Sessions  and  Rosenstein  each  spoke  to  McGahn  and expressed 
concern that the White House was creating a narrative that Rosenstein had initiated the decision to

fire Comey.484  The White House Counsel's Office agreed that it was factually wrong to say that 
the  Department of Justice had initiated Corney's termination,485  and McGahn asked attorneys  in 
the White House Counsel's Office to work with the press office to correct the narrative.486 

The next day, on May 11, 2017, the President participated in an interview with Lester Holt. 
The President told White House Counsel's Office attorneys  in  advance of the interview that the 
communications team could not get the story right,  so  he  was going on Lester Holt to say what 
really happened.487  During the interview, the President stated that he had made the decision to fire 
Corney  before the President met with Rosenstein and Sessions.  The President told Holt, "I was 
going  to  fire  regardless  of recommendation  .  .  . .  [Rosenstein]  made  a  recommendation.  But 
regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Corney knowing there was no good time to do 
it."488  The President continued, "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself-I said, 
you  know,  this Russia thing with Trump and  Russia is  a  made-up  story.  It's an  excuse by  the 
Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."489 

In  response  to  a  question  about  whether  he  was  angry  with  Corney  about  the  Russia 
investigation, the President said, "As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done 
properly."490  The President added that he realized his termination of Corney "probably maybe will 
confuse people" with the result that it "might even  lengthen out the  investigation," but he "ha[d] 
to do the right thing for the American people" and Corney was "the wrong man for that position."491 
The President described  Corney as  "a showboat" and "a  grandstander," said that "[t]he FBI has 
been  in  turmoil,"  and  said  he  wanted  "to  have  a  really  competent,  capable  director." 492  The 
President affirmed that he expected the new FBI director to continue the Russia investigation.493 

On  the  evening  of May  11 ,  2017,  following  the  Lester  Holt  interview,  the  President 
tweeted, "Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching  as the U.S.  tears  itself apart over a 
Democrat  EXCUSE  for  losing  the  election."494  The  same  day,  the  media  reported  that  the 
President had demanded that Corney pledge his loyalty to the President in a private dinner shortly

after being sworn in.495  Late in  the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, " Again, the 
story that there was collusion between the Russians &  Trump campaign was fabricated  by Dems 
as an  excuse for losing the election."496  The President also tweeted, "James Corney better hope 
that there  are  no 'tapes'  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"  and  "When 
James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there 
is no collusion, when does it end?"497 

Analysis 

In analyzing the President's decision to fire Corney, the following  evidence is relevant to 

the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  The act of firing  Corney removed  the  individual overseeing the 
FBI's  Russia  investigation.  The  President  knew  that  Corney  was  personally  involved  in  the 
investigation based on Corney's briefing of the Gang of Eight, Corney's March 20, 2017 public 
testimony about the investigation, and the President's one-on-one conversations with Corney. 

Firing Corney would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect 
of interfering with or impeding the investigation-for example, if the termination would have the 
effect of delaying or disrupting the  investigation or providing the President with the opportunity 
to appoint a  director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President 
perceived as more  protective of his  personal  interests.  Relevant circumstances bearing on  that 
issue include whether the President's actions had the potential to discourage a successor director 
or other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation.  The President fired 
Corney abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, 
and criticized him publicly, calling him a " showboat" and claiming that the FBI was " in turmoil" 
under his leadership.  And the President followed the termination with public statements that were 
highly  critical  of the  investigation;  for  example,  three  days  after  firing  Corney,  the  President 
referred to the investigation as a "witch hunt"  and asked, "when does it end?"  Those actions had 
the potential to affect a successor director' s conduct of the investigation. 

The anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to 
prevent  or  impede  the  FBI  from  continuing  its  investigation.  As  a  general  matter,  FBI 
investigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. 
Bannon  made a  similar point when  he told  the  President that he  could fire the FBI director,  but 
could not fire the FBI.  The White House issued a  press statement the day after Corney was fired 
that  said,  "The  investigation  would  have  always continued,  and  obviously,  the  termination  of 
Corney  would  not have ended  it."  Tn  addition,  in  his  May  11  interview with  Lester Holt,  the 
President stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Corney that the action might 
prolong the  investigation.  And the  President chose  McCabe  to  serve as  interim  director,  even

though McCabe told the President he had worked "very closely"  with Corney and was part of all 
the decisions made in the Clinton investigation. 

b. 

Nexus to a proceeding.  The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing 
that  a  grand  jury  proceeding  or  criminal  prosecution  arising  from  an  FBI  investigation  was 
objectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Corney. 

Several facts would be relevant to such a showing.  At .the time the President fired Corney, 
a grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury 
subpoenas had  been issued.  On March 20,  2017, however,  Corney  had announced  that the FBI 
was investigating Russia's interference  in  the election,  including "an assessment of whether any 
crimes were committed."  It was widely known that the FBI, as part of the  Russia investigation, 
was investigating the hacking of the DNC's computers-a clear criminal offense. 

In addition, at the time the President fired Corney, evidence  indicates the President knew 
that Flynn was still under criminal  investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the 
President's February 14, 2017 request that Corney "let[] Flynn go."  On March 5, 2017, the White 
House  Counsel's  Office  was  informed  that  the  FBI  was  asking  for  transition-period  records 
relating to Flynn-
indicating that the FBI was still actively investigating him.  The same day, the 
President told  advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the 
Russia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated. 
On March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in  legal jeopardy by 
tweeting that "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity" before he agreed to provide testimony to the 
FBI  or Congress.  And  in  late  March  or early April,  the  President asked McFarland  to pass  a 
message  to Flynn  telling  him  that the President felt  bad  for  him  and that he should stay strong, 
further demonstrating the President's awareness of Flynn's criminal exposure. 

c. 

Intent.  Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President' s decision 
to fire Corney was Corney 's unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally 
under  investigation,  despite  the  President's  repeated  requests  that  Corney  make  such  an 
announcement.  In  the  week leading  up to  Corney's May  3,  2017  Senate  Judiciary  Committee 
testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Corney did not set the record 
straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation.  But during his May 
3  testimony,  Corney  refused  to  answer  questions  about  whether  the  President  was  being 
investigated.  Corney's refusal  angered the President,  who  criticized  Sessions  for  leaving  him 
isolated  and  exposed,  saying  "You  left  me  on  an  island."  Two  days  later,  the  President told 
advisors he had decided  to  fire  Corney and dictated a  letter to Stephen Miller that began with a 
reference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: "While I greatly appreciate you 
informing me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated 
story on  a  Trump-Russia  relationship  .... "  The President later asked Rosenstein  to  include 
"Russia" in his memorandum and to say that Corney had told the President that he was not under 
investigation.  And the President's final termination  letter included a  sentence, at the President's 
insistence  and  against  McGahn' s  advice,  stating  that  Corney  had  told  the  President  on  three 
separate occasions that he was not under investigation. 

The President's other stated rationales for why he fired Corney are not similarly supported 
by the evidence.  The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in  Bedminster 

75

U.S. Department of Justice 

cited Corney' s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired 
Corney  for  that  reason.  But  the  facts  surrounding  Corney's  handling  of the  Clinton  email 
investigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the  President 
had  made  it  clear to  both  Corney and  the  President' s  senior staff in  early 2017 that he wanted 
Corney to stay on as director.  And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Corney's handling of the 
Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Corney.  The President's draft 
termination  letter also  stated that morale  in  the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told  the 
press after Corney's termination that the White House had heard from "countless" FBI agents who 
had lost confidence in Corney.  But the evidence does not support those claims.  The President told 
Corney  at  their  January  27  dinner  that "the  people  of the  FBI  really  like  [him],"  no  evidence 
suggests  that the  President heard  otherwise  before deciding  to  terminate  Corney,  and  Sanders 
acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything. 

We also considered why it was important to the President that Corney announce publicly 
that he was not under investigation.  Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the 
erroneous  perception  he  was  under  investigation  harmed  his  ability  to  manage  domestic  and 
foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia.  The President told Corney that the "cloud" of 
"this Russia business" was making it difficult to run the country.  The President told Sessions and 
McGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that 
the perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues. 
The President complained to Rogers that "the thing with the Russians [ was] messing up" his ability 
to get things done with Russia, and told Coats, "I can't do anything with Russia, there's things I'd 
like to  do  with  Russia, with trade, with  ISIS, they' re all over me  with this."  The President also 
may have viewed Corney as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in  the May 3 testimony that 
the President was not under investigation. 

Other evidence,  however, indicates that the President wanted to  protect himself from  an 
investigation  into  his campaign.  The day after learning about the  FBI's interview of Flynn,  the 
President had a one-on-one dinner with Corney, against the advice of senior aides, and told Corney 
he needed Corney's "loyalty."  When the President later asked Corney for a second time to  make 
public that he was not under investigation,  he  brought up  loyalty  again, saying "Because I  have 
been very loyal  to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know."  After the President learned of 
Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an 
Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder 
to have protected their presidents.  The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney 
General "who to investigate." 

In addition, the President had a  motive to put the FBI's Russia investigation behind  him. 
The  evidence  does  not  establish  that  the  termination  of Corney  was  designed  to  cover  up  a 
conspiracy between  the Trump Campaign and Russia:  As  described  in  Volume I, the evidence 
uncovered  in  the  investigation  did  not  establish  that  the  President  or those  close  to  him  were 
involved  in  the  charged  Russian  computer-hacking or active-measure  conspiracies,  or  that  the 
President otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official.  But the evidence does 
indicate  that  a  thorough  FBI  investigation  would  uncover  facts  about  the  campaign  and  the 
President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise 
to  personal and  political concerns.  Although  the President publicly  stated  during and after the 
election that he had  no connection  to Russia,  the  Trump Organization, through Michael  Cohen,

was pursuing the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project through June 2016 and candidate Trump 
was repeatedly briefed on the  ro  ress of those efforts.498  In addition,  some witnesses said that

. - - at a time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the 
hacks,  and  that Trump  privately  sought  information  about future  WikiLeaks releases.499  More 
broadly,  multiple  witnesses described  the  President's preoccupation with  press  coverage of the 
Russia investigation and his persistent concern that it raised questions about the legitimacy of his 
election.500

· 

Finally, the President and White House aides  initially advanced a  pretextual reason to the 
press  and  the  public  for  Corney's  termination. 
In  the  immediate  aftermath  of the  firing,  the 
President  dictated  a  press  statement  suggesting  that  he  had  acted  based  on 
the  DOJ 
recommendations,  and White House  press  officials  repeated  that story.  But the President  had 
decided to fire Corney before the White House solicited those recommendations.  Although the 
President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Corney regardless of the Department 
of Justice's recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would 
resist  the  White  House' s  suggestion  that  they  had  prompted  the  process  that  led  to  Corney's 
termination.  The initial reliance on a  pretextual justification could support an inference that the 
President had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although the evidence does 
not resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both. 

E. 

The President's Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel 

Overview 

The Acting Attorney General  appointed  a  Special Counsel  on May  17,  2017,  prompting 
the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had 
failed to protect him and should resign.  Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President 
ultimately did not accept.  The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts 
of interest, but they  responded that those claims were "ridiculous" and posed no obstacle to the 
Special  Counsel' s  service.  Department of Justice ethics  officials  similarly  cleared  the  Special 
Counsel's service.  On June  14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally 
investigated  for  obstruction  of justice  and  the  President  responded  with  a  series  of tweets 

498 See Volume II, Section II.K. l, infra. 
499 See Volume l, Section ITLD.1, supra. 
500  In addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an  FBI 
investigation could uncover, we considered whether the President's intent in firing Corney was connected 
to  other conduct that could  come  to  light as a  result of the FBT 's Russian-interference  investigation.  In 
paiticular,  Michael  Cohen  was a  potential  subject of investigation  because of his pursuit of the Trump 
Tower  Moscow  project  and  involvement  in  other  activities.  And  facts  uncovered  in  the  Russia 
investigation, which our Office  referred  to the  U.S.  Attorney's Office for the  Southern  District of New 
York, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District ofNew York for campaign-finance 
offenses related to  payments  he said  he made  at the  direction of the President.  See Volume  II, Section 
II.K.5,  infra.  The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired  Corney, he  was 
considering the possibility that the FBI's investigation would uncover these payments or that the President's 
intent in firing Corney was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to  light.

criticizing the Special Counsel' s  investigation.  That weekend, the President called  McGahn and 
directed  him  to  have  the  Special  Counsel  removed  because  of asserted  conflicts  of interest. 
McGahn  did not  carry  out the instruction  for fear of being  seen as triggering  another Saturday 
Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign.  McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President 
did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel removed. 

Evidence 

I.  The Appointment of the Special Counsel and the President's Reaction 

On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller, ITT as 
Special  Counsel  and  authorized  him to  conduct the  Russia  investigation and matters  that arose 
from  the  investigation.501  The  President  learned  of the  Special  Counsel's  appointment  from 
Sessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and  McGahn conducting interviews for a  new FBI 
Director.502  Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him 
about the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the 
news.503  According  to  notes  written  by Hunt,  when  Sessions  told  the  President that  a  Special 
Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in  his chair and said, "Oh my God.  This 
is terrible.  This  is the end of my Presidency.  I' m fucked." 504  The President became angry and 
lambasted the Attorney General for  his decision to recuse from the investigation,  stating, "How 
could you let this happen, Jeff?"505  The President said the position of Attorney General was his 
most  important  appointment  and  that  Sessions  had  " let  [him]  down," contrasting  him  to  Eric 
Holder  and  Robert  Kennedy.506  Sessions  recalled  that  the  President  said  to  him,  "you  were 
supposed to protect me," or words to that effect.507  The President returned to the consequences of 
the appointment and said, "Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins 
your presidency.  It takes years and years and I won 't  be able to do anything.  This  is the worst 
thing that ever happened to me."508

The President then told Sessions he should resign as Attorney General.509  Sessions agreed 
to submit his resignation and left the Oval Office.510  Hicks saw the President shortly after Sessions 
departed  and  described  the  President  as  being  extremely  upset  by  the  Special  Counsel's 
appointment.51 1  Hicks said that she had only seen the President like that one other time, when the 
Access Hollywood tape came out during the campaign.5 12 

The next day, May  18,  2017, FBI agents delivered  to  McGahn a  preservation notice that 
discussed  an  investigation  related  to  Corney's  termination  and  directed  the  White  House  to 
preserve all relevant documents.513  When he received the letter, McGahn issued a document hold 
to White House staff and instructed them not to send out any burn bags over the weekend while 
he sorted things out.514 

Also  on  May  18,  Sessions  finalized  a  resignation  letter  that  stated,  "Pursuant  to  our 
conversation  of yesterday,  and  at  your  request,  I  hereby  offer  my  resignation."515  Sessions, 
accompanied by Hunt, brought the letter to the White House and handed it to the President.516  The 
President put the  resignation  letter  in  his  pocket and  asked  Sessions  several  times  whether he 
wanted  to  continue  serving  as  Attorney  General.517  Sessions  ultimately  told  the  President he 
wanted to stay, but it was up to the President. 518  The President said he wanted Sessions to stay.519 
At the  conclusion  of the  meeting,  the  President  shook  Sessions's  hand  but  did  not  return  the 
resignation letter.520 

When  Priebus  and  Bannon  learned  that  the  President  was  holding  onto  Sessions's 
resignation  letter,  they  became concerned that it could  be used  to  influence  the  Department of 
Justice.52 1  Priebus told  Sessions  it was not good for  the  President to  have  the letter  because  it

would function as a kind of "shock collar" that the President could use any time he wanted; Priebus 
said  the  President had "DOJ  by  the  throat."522  Priebus  and  Bannon  told  Sessions they would 
attempt  to  get  the  letter  back  from  the  President  with  a  notation  that  he  was  not  accepting 
Sessions's resignation.523 

On May 19, 2017, the President left for a trip to the Middle East.524  Hicks recalled that on 
the President's flight from  Saudi Arabia to Tel Aviv, the President pulled Sessions's resignation 
letter from his pocket, showed it to a group of senior advisors, and asked them what he should do 
about it.525  During the  trip,  Priebus  asked about the resignation  letter so  he could return  it  to 
Sessions, but the President told him that the letter was back at the White House, somewhere in the 
residence.526  It was not until May 30, three days after the President returned from the trip, that the 
President returned the letter to Sessions with a notation saying, "Not accepted." 527 

2.  The President Asse11s that the Special Counsel has Conflicts of Interest 

In  the  days  following  the  Special  Counsel's  appointment,  the  President repeatedly  told 
advisors,  including Priebus, Bannon, and McGahn, that Special Counsel Mueller had conflicts of 
interest.528  The President cited  as  conflicts  that Mueller had  interviewed  for  the  FBI  Director 
position sho11ly before being appointed as Special Counsel, that he had worked for a  law firm that 
represented people affiliated with the President, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating 
to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia.529  The President's advisors pushed

back  on  his  assertion  of conflicts,  telling  the  President  they  did  not count as true  conflicts.530 
Bannon recalled telling the President that the purported conflicts were "ridiculous" and that none 
of them was real  or could come  close  to justifying  precluding Mueller from  serving as  Special 
Counsel.531  As for Mueller's interview for FBI Director, Bannon recalled that the White House 
had invited Mueller to speak to the President to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI.532 
Bannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director 
again, he did not come in looking for the job.533  Bannon also told the President that the law firm 
position did not amount to a conflict in  the legal community.534  And Bannon told the  President 
that the golf course dispute did not rise to the level of a conflict and claiming one was "ridiculous 
and petty."535  The President did not respond when Bannon pushed back on the stated conflicts of 
interest. 536 

On May 23, 2017, the Department of Justice announced that ethics officials had determined 
that the Special Counsel's prior law firm  position did not bar his service, generating media reports 
that  Mueller  had  been  cleared  to  serve.537  McGahn  recalled  that  around  the  same  time,  the 
President complained about the asserted conflicts and prodded McGahn to reach out to Rosenstein 
about the  issue.538  McGahn  said  he  responded  that he could  not make such  a  call  and  that the 
President should instead consult his personal  lawyer because it was not a White House issue.539 
Contemporaneous  notes  of a  May  23,  2017  conversation  between  McGahn  and  the  President 
reflect that McGahn told the President that he would not call Rosenstein and that he would suggest 
that the President not make such a call either.540  McGahn advised that the President could discuss 
the  issue  with  his  personal  attorney  but  it  would  "look  like  still  trying  to  meddle  in  [the] 
investigation"  and "knocking out Mueller" would be "[a]nother fact used to claim obst[ruction] of 

documents.  10/27/ 11  Letter, Muellers to Trump National  Golf Club.  The Muellers have not had  further

just[ice]."541  McGahn  told  the President that  his  "biggest  exposure"  was  not his  act of firing 
Corney  but his  "other contacts"  and  "calls," and  his  "ask re:  Flynn."542  By the time McGahn 
provided  this  advice  to  the  President,  there  had  been  widespread  reporting  on  the  President's 
request for  Corney's loyalty,  which  the  President publicly denied;  his request that Corney "let[] 
Flynn go," which the President also denied; and the President' s statement to the Russian Foreign 
Minister that the termination of Corney had relieved "great pressure"  related to Russia, which the 
President did not deny.543 

On June 8, 2017, Corney testified before Congress about his interactions with the President 
before his termination, including the request for loyalty, the request that Corney " let[] Flynn go," 
and  the  request  that  Corney  "lift  the  cloud"  over  the  presidency  caused  by  the  ongoing 
investigation.544  Corney's testimony led to a  series of news reports about whether the President 
had obstructedjustice.545  On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed the White House 
Counsel's Office that investigators intended to interview intelligence community officials who had 
allegedly been asked by the President to push back against the Russia investigation.546 

On Monday, June  12, 2017, Christopher Ruddy,  the chief executive ofNewsmax Media 
and  a  longtime  friend  of the  President's, met at the White House with  Priebus and Bannon.547

and  that  he  would  do  so  precipitously,  without  vetting  the  decision  through  Administration 
officials.548  Ruddy asked Priebus if Ruddy could talk publicly about the discussion they had about 
the Special Counsel, and Priebus said he could.549  Priebus told Ruddy he hoped another blow up 
like  the one that followed  the termination  of Corney did  not  happen.550  Later that  day,  Ruddy 
stated in a televised interview that the President was "considering perhaps terminating the Special 
Counsel" based  on  purported conflicts of interest.551  Ruddy  later told another news outlet that 
"Trump is definitely considering" terminating the Special Counsel and "it's not something that' s 
being dismissed."552  Ruddy's comments led to extensive coverage in  the media that the President 
was considering firing the Special Counsel.553 

White  House  officials  were  unhappy  with  that  press  coverage  and  Ruddy  heard  from 
friends that the President was upset with  him.554  On June  13, 2017, Sanders asked the President 
for  guidance  on  how  to  respond  to  press  inquiries  about  the  possible  firing  of the  Special 
Counsel.555  The President dictated an answer, which Sanders delivered, saying that " [w]hile the 
president has every right to" fire the Special Counsel, "he has no intention to do so."556 

Also on June  13,  2017, the President' s  personal  counsel contacted the Special  Counsel's 
Office  and  raised concerns about  possible conflicts.557  The President's counsel cited Mueller's 
previous partnership  in  his  law firm,  his  interview for the FBI Director position,  and an asserted 
personal  relationship  he  had  with  Comey.558  That same  day,  Rosenstein  had  testified  publicly

3.  The Press Reports that the President is  Being Investigated for Obstruction of 
Justice and the President Directs the White House Counsel to Have the Special 
Counsel Removed 

On the evening of June l 4, 20 l 7, the Washington Post published an article stating that the 
Special Counsel was investigating whether the President had attempted to obstructjustice.561  This 
was  the  first  public  report  that  the  President  himself was  under  investigation  by  the  Special 
Counsel's Office,  and cable  news  networks quickly  picked up on  the  report.562  The  Post story 
stated that the Special Counsel was interviewing intelligence community leaders, including Coats 
and Rogers,  about what the  President had  asked  them to do  in response  to Corney's March 20, 
20 l 7  testimony;  that  the  inquiry  into  obstruction  marked  "a  major  turning  point"  in  the 
investigation;  and  that while  "Trump  had  received  private  assurances  from  then-FBI  Director 
James  B.  Corney starting in January that he was not personally under investigation,"  "[ o ]fficials 
say that changed shortly after Corney ' s firing." 563  That evening, at approximately l 0:3 l  p.m., the 
President  called  McGahn  on  McGahn' s  personal  cell  phone  and  they  spoke  for  about  l 5 
minutes.564  McGahn did not have a clear memory of the call but thought they might have discussed 
the stories reporting that the President was under investigation.565 

Beginning  early  the  next  day,  June  15,  2017,  the  President  issued  a  series  of tweets 
acknowledging the existence of the obstruction investigation and criticizing it.  He wrote: "They 
made  up  a  phony  collusion  with  the  Russians  story,  found  zero  proof,  so  now  they  go  for 
obstruction of justice on the phony story.  Nice";566 "You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH 
HUNT  in  American  political  history-led  by  some  very  bad  and  conflicted  people!";567  and

before  she was  cleared- &  they  talk  about obstruction?"568  The  next day,  June  16,  2017,  the 
President wrote additional tweets criticizing the investigation: "After 7  months of investigations 
&  committee hearings about my ' collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any 
proof.  Sad!";569  and "I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me 
to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt."570 

On  Saturday, June  17,  2017, the President called McGahn and  directed  him  to  have the 
Special Counsel removed.571  McGahn was at home and the President was at Camp David.572  In 
interviews with this Office, McGahn recalled that the President called him at home twice and on 
both occasions directed him to call Rosenstein and say that Mueller had conflicts that precluded 
him from serving as Special Counsel.573 

On the  first call, McGahn recalled that the  President said something like,  "You  gotta do 
this.  You gotta call Rod."574  McGahn said he told the President that he would see what he could 
do.575  McGahn was perturbed by the call and did not intend to act on the request.576  He and other 
advisors  believed  the  asserted  conflicts  were  "silly"  and  "not  real,"  and  they  had  previously 
communicated that view to the President.577  McGahn also had made clear to the President that the 
White House Counsel's Office should not be involved in any effort to press the issue of conflicts.578 
McGahn was concerned about having any role in asking the Acting Attorney General to fire  the 
Special  Counsel because he  had  grown  up in the Reagan era and wanted to  be more like Judge

Robert Bork and  not " Saturday Night Massacre  Bork."579  McGahn  considered  the President's 
request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brakes.580 

When  the  President called  McGahn  a  second time  to  follow  up  on  the  order to call the 
Department of Justice, McGahn recalled that the President was more direct, saying something like, 
"Call  Rod,  tell  Rod  that Mueller has  conflicts  and  can 't  be  the  Special  Counsel."581  McGahn 
recalled  the  President telling  him  "Mueller has  to  go" and  "Call  me  back when  you  do  it."582 
McGahn understood  the  President to  be saying that the Special  Counsel  had  to  be  removed  by 
Rosenstein.583  To end the  conversation  with the President, McGahn  left the President with  the 
impression that McGahn would call Rosenstein. 584  McGahn recalled that he had already said no 
to the President's request and he was worn down, so he just wanted to get off the phone.585 

McGahn recalled feeling trapped because he did not plan to follow the President's directive 
but did not know what he would say the next time the President called.586  McGahn decided he had 
to resign.587  He called his personal lawyer and then called his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, to 
inform  her of his decision.588  He then  drove to  the office to pack his belongings and submit his 
resignation  letter.589  Donaldson  recalled  that  McGahn  told  her  the  President  had  called  and 
demanded he contact the Department of Justice and that the President wanted him to do something 
that McGahn did not want to do. 590  McGahn told Donaldson that the President had called at least 
twice and  in  one of the calls asked "have you  done  it?"591  McGahn did not tell  Donaldson the 
specifics of the  President's request  because he  was consciously trying  not  to  involve  her in the

investigation,  but  Donaldson  inferred  that  the  President's  directive  was  related  to  the  Russia 
investigation.592  Donaldson prepared to resign along with McGahn.593 

That evening, McGahn called both Priebus and Bannon and told them that he intended to 
resign.594  McGahn  recalled  that,  after  speaking with  his  attorney  and  given  the  nature of the 
President' s  request,  he  decided  not to  share details of the  President's  request with  other White 
House staff.595  Priebus recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to "do crazy 
shit,"  but  he thought  McGahn  did  not tell  him  the  specifics  of the  President's  request  because 
McGahn was trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know.596  Priebus and Bannon 
both  urged  McGahn  not  to  quit,  and  McGahn  ultimately  returned  to  work  that  Monday  and 
remained  in  his position.597  He had not told  the President directly that he planned to resign,  and 
when they next saw each other the President did not ask McGahn whether he had followed through 
with calling Rosenstein.598 

Around the same time, Chris Christie recalled a telephone_call with the President in which 
the  President  asked  what  Christie  thought  about  the  President  firing  the  Special  Counsel.599 
Christie advised against doing so  because there was no substantive basis for the President to fire 
the Special Counsel, and because the President would lose support from Republicans in Congress 
if he did so.600 

Analysis 

In  analyzing the President's  direction  to  McGahn to have  the  Special Counsel removed, 

the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  As with  the  President's firing  of Corney, the attempt to  remove

investigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.  Even if the removal 
of the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee, 
a factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the 
investigation,  chill  the  actions  of any  replacement  Special  Counsel,  or  otherwise  impede  the 
investigation. 

A threshold question is whetherthe President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special 
Counsel removed.  After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered 
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and 
privately told  McGahn that  he  had  simply wanted  McGahn  to  bring conflicts  of interest to the 
Department of Justice 's  attention.  See  Volume  II,  Section  II.I,  infra.  Some  of the President's 
specific  language  that  McGahn  recalled  from  the  calls  is  consistent  with  that  explanation. 
Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in  fact 
directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed. 

First, McGahn's clear recollection was that the President directed him to  tell  Rosenstein 
not only that conflicts existed  but also  that  "Mueller has to go."  McGahn is a  credible witness 
with  no motive to lie  or exaggerate given the  position  he held  in  the White  House.601  McGahn 
spoke with  the President twice and understood the directive the  same way both times,  making it 
unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the  President's request.  In  response to that request, 
McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin 
to the  Saturday Night Massacre.  He called his  lawyer, drove to the White House,  packed up his 
office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President 
had asked him to "do crazy shit," and  informed Priebus and Bannon that he was  leaving.  Those 
acts would be a  highly unusual  reaction to a  request to convey information to the Department of 
Justice. 

Second,  in  the days  before the calls to  McGahn,  the President,  through  his counsel,  had 
already brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice.  Accordingly, 
the President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues 
that already had been raised. 

Third, the President's sense ofurgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate 
action on a weekend-" You gotta do this.  You gotta call Rod."-supp0ti McGahn's recollection 
that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel. 
Had  the  President  instead  sought  only  to  have  the  Department  of Justice  re-examine  asserted 
conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the 
process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn. 

Finally, the President had discussed "knocking out Mueller" and raised conflicts of interest 
in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan 
to remove the Special Counsel.  And in  the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made 
clear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating 

60 1 When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic,  he was reluctant to share detailed 
information about what had  occurred and only did so after continued questioning.  See McGahn  12/14/17

the Special Counsel.  Also during this time period, the President reached out to Christie to get his 
thoughts on firing the Special Counsel.  This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking 
an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a 
way to terminate the Special Counsel. 

b. 

Nexus to an  official  proceeding.  To satisfy the proceeding requirement,  it would 
be  necessary to establish a nexus between the President's act of seeking to terminate the Special 
Counsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding. 

Substantial evidence indicates that by June  17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was 
under investigation by a federal  prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a 
grand jury.  On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his "biggest exposure" 
was not his act of firing Corney but his "other contacts" and "calls," and his "ask re: Flynn."  By 
early  June,  it was  widely  reported  in  t}:ie  media that  federal  prosecutors  had  issued  grand jury 
subpoenas  in  the  Flynn  inquiry  and  that  the  Special  Counsel  had  taken  over  the  Flynn 
investigation.602  On June  9,  2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed  the  White House that 
investigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by 
the President to push back against the Russia investigation.  On June 14, 2017, news outlets began 
reporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice.  Based on 
widespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for 
Corney's loyalty; his request that Corney "let[] Flynn go"; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and 
his termination of Corney and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had 
relieved "great pressure"  related to Russia.  And on  June  16,  2017,  the  day before  he  directed 
McGahn  to  have  the  Special  Counsel  removed,  the  President  publicly  acknowledged  that  his 
conduct was under  investigation  by a  federal  prosecutor,  tweeting,  "I  am  being investigated for 
firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!" 

c. 

Intent.  Substantial evidence indicates that the  President's attempts to remove the 
Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the 
President's conduct- and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated 
for potential obstruction of justice. 

Before the President terminated Corney, the President considered it critically important that 
he was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated. 
As  described  in  Volume TI,  Section TI.D, supra,  advisors  perceived the  President, while  he was 
drafting the Corney termination letter, to  be concerned more than anything else about getting out 
that he was not personally under investigation.  When the President learned of the appointment of 
the Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying 
"[t]his is the end of my Presidency."  The President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying "you 
were supposed to  protect me." 

On  June  14,  20 I 7,  when  the  Washington  Post  reported  that  the  Special  Counsel  was 
investigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted

to avoid: a  criminal  investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media 
attention.  The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President 
to call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed.  By mid-June, the Department of 
Justice had already cleared the Special Counsel's service and the President's advisors had told him 
that the claimed conflicts of interest were "silly" and did not provide a basis to remove the Special 
Counsel.  On June  13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good 
cause for  removing the Special  Counsel existed, and  the  President dictated  a  press statement to 
Sanders  saying he  had  no  intention of firing  the  Special  Counsel.  But the  next day,  the  media 
reported  that the  President  was  under  investigation  for  obstruction  of justice  and  the  Special 
Counsel  was  interviewing  witnesses about events  related  to  possible  obstruction- spurring  the 
President to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel's investigation.  The President called 
McGahn  at home  that night and then  called him  on  Saturday from  Camp David.  The evidence 
accordingly indicates that news that an  obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the 
President to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated. 

There also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls to 
McGahn.  The  President  made  the  calls  to  McGahn  after  McGahn  had  specifically  told  the 
President that the White House Counsel's Office-and McGahn himself-could not be  involved 
in  pressing conflicts claims and that the President should  consult with his personal counsel  if he 
wished to raise conflicts.  Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, 
the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel.  And after the media 
reported  on the President's actions,  he denied that he  ever ordered McGahn to  have the  Special 
Counsel  terminated and  made  repeated  efforts to  have  McGahn deny the story,  as  discussed  in 
Volume  II,  Section  II.I,  infra.  Those  denials  are  contrary  to  the  evidence  and  suggest  the 
President's awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper. 

F. 

The President's Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation 

Overview 

Two days  after the President directed McGahn to  have the Special Counsel removed, the 
President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation.  On June 19, 2017, 
the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message 
to  be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia 
investigation to future election interference only.  One month later, the President met again with 
Lewandowski  and  followed  up  on  the  request  to  have  Sessions  limit  the  scope  of the  Russia 
investigation.  Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon.  Hours later, 
the President publicly criticized Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about 
Sessions' s job security. 

1.  The President Asks Corey Lewandowski to Deliver a  Message to  Sessions to 

Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation 

On  June  19,  2017,  two  days  after  the  President  directed  McGahn  to  have  the  Special 
Counsel  removed,  the  President  met one-on-one  in  the  Oval  Office with  his  former  campaign

manager  Corey Lewandowski.603_  Senior  White  House  advisors  described  Lewandowski  as  a 
"devotee" of the President and said the relationship between the President and Lewandowski was 
"close."604 

During  the  June  19  meeting,  Lewandowski  recalled  that,  after  some  small  talk,  the 
President brought up  Sessions  and criticized his  recusal  from  the Russia  investigation.605  The 
President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the 
likelihood of recusal  in  advance,  he  would  not have appointed Sessions.606  The President then 
asked Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions and said "write this down." 607  This was the 
first time the President had asked Lewandowski to take dictation, and Lewandowski wrote as fast 
as possible to make sure he captured the content correctly.608 

The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing: 

I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas.  But our 
POTUS . .. is being treated very unfairly.  He shouldn't have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel 
b/c he hasn't done anything wrong.  I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there 
were no  Russians  involved with him.  I  know it for a  fact b/c I was there.  He didn't do 
anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.609 

The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to  limit 
his jurisdiction to future election interference: 

Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States.  T am going 
to  meet with  the  Special  Prosecutor  to  explain  this  is  very  unfair  and  let  the  Special 
Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that 
nothing can happen in future elections.6 10

had meetings with friends  like  Lewandowski, Kelly  tried not to be there and to push the  meetings to the 
residence to create distance from the West Wing.  Kelly 8/2/18 302, at 7.

The President said that if Sessions delivered that statement he would be the "most popular guy in 
the country."6 11  Lewandowski told the President he understood what the President wanted Sessions 
to do.6 12 

Lewandowski  wanted  to  pass  the  message  to  Sessions  in  person  rather  than  over  the 
phone.613  He did not want to meet at the Department of Justice because he did not want a public 
log of his  visit  and  did  not want  Sessions to  have an  advantage  over him  by  meeting on  what 
Lewandowski  described  as  Sessions's  turf. 614  Lewandowski  called  Sessions  and  arranged  a 
meeting for the following evening at Lewandowski's office, but Sessions had to cancel due to a 
last minute conflict.6 15  Shortly thereafter, Lewandowski  left Washington,  D .C.,  without having 
had an  opportunity to  meet with  Sessions to  convey the President's message.6 16  Lewandowski 
stored the notes  in  a safe at his home, which he stated was his standard procedure with sensitive 
items.617 

2.  The President Follows Up with Lewandowski 

Following his  June  meeting  with the President,  Lewandowski  contacted Rick Dearborn, 
then  a  senior White House official, and asked if Dearborn could pass a  message  to  Sessions.618 
Dearborn agreed without knowing what the message was, and Lewandowski later confirmed that 
Dearborn would meet with Sessions for dinner in  late July and could deliver the message then.619 
Lewandowski recalled thinking that the President had asked him to pass the message because the 
President knew Lewandowski could be trusted, but Lewandowski believed Dearborn would be a 
better messenger because he had a longstanding relationship with Sessions and because Dearborn 
was in the government while Lewandowski was not.620 

On July 19, 2017, the President again met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office.621 
In the preceding days, as described in Volume IT, Section ILG, infra, emails and other information 
about the June  9, 2016 meeting between several Russians and Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, 
and Paul Manafort had been publicly disclosed.  In the July  19 meeting with Lewandowski,  the

President  raised  his  previous  request  and  asked  if Lewandowski  had  talked  to  Sessions.622 
Lewandowski  told  the  President  that  the  message  would  be  delivered  soon.623  Lewandowski 
recalled that the President told  him  that if Sessions did  not meet with  him,  Lewandowski should 
tell Sessions he was fired.624 

Immediately following the meeting with the President, Lewandowski saw Dearborn in the 
anteroom outside the Oval Office and gave him a typewritten version of the message the President 
had dictated to  be delivered to  Sessions.625  Lewandowski told  Dearborn that the notes were the 
message they had discussed, but Dearborn did not recall whether Lewandowski said the message 
was  from  the  President.626  The message  "definitely  raised  an  eyebrow"  for  Dearborn,  and  he 
recalled  not wanting to ask where it came from  or think further about doing anything with  it.627 
Dearborn  also  said  that  being  asked  to  serve  as  a  messenger  to  Sessions  made  him 
uncomfortable. 628  He recalled later telling Lewandowski that he  had handled the situation, but he 
did  not  actually  follow through  with  delivering the  message to  Sessions, and he  did not keep  a 
copy of the typewritten notes Lewandowski had given him.629 

3.  The President Publicly Criticizes Sessions in a New York Times Interview 

Within hours of the President's meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President 
gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions's decision to 
recuse  from  the  Russia  investigation.630  The  President  said  that  "Sessions  should  have  never 
recused himself, and  if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the 
job, and I would have picked somebody else."631  Sessions's recusal, the President said, was "very 
unfair to the president.  How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?  Ifhe would have recused 
himself before the job, I would have said, 'Thanks, Jeff, but I can' t, you know, I'm not going to

present  for  the  interview,  recalled  trying  to  "throw  [herself]  between  the  reporters  and  [the 
President]" to stop parts of the interview, but the President "loved the interview."633 

Later that day, Lewandowski met with Hicks and they discussed the President's New York 
Times interview.634  Lewandowski recalled telling Hicks about the President's request that he meet 
with Sessions and joking with her about the idea of firing Sessions as a private citizen  if Sessions 
would not meet with him.635  As Hicks remembered the conversation, Lewandowski told her the 
President had recently asked him to meet with  Sessions and deliver a message that he needed to 
do  the  "right thing" and  resign.636  While  Hicks and  Lewandowski were together,  the President 
called Hicks and  told  her he  was  happy  with how coverage of his New York Times  interview 
criticizing Sessions was p laying out.637 

4.  The President Orders Priebus to Demand Sessions's Resignation 

Three days  later,  on  July  21, 2017,  the  Washington Post repo1ted  that  U.S.  intelligence 
intercepts  showed  that  Sessions  had  discussed  campaign-related  matters  with  the  Russian 
ambassador, contrary to what Sessions had said publicly.638  That evening, Priebus called Hunt to 
talk about whether Sessions might be  fired  or might resign.639  Priebus had previously talked  to 
Hunt when the  media  had  reported  on  tensions  between  Sessions  and  the  President, and,  after 
speaking to Sessions, Hunt had  told Priebus that the President would have to fire Sessions  if he 
wanted to  remove  Sessions  because Sessions was not going to  quit.640  According to Hunt, who 
took contemporaneous notes of the  July 21  call,  Hunt told Priebus that,  as they  had  previously 
discussed, Sessions had no intention ofresigning.641  Hunt asked Priebus what the President would

Early  the  following  morning,  July  22,  2017, 

the  President  tweeted,  "A  new 
INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions. 
These  illegal  leaks,  like  Corney's,  must stop!"643  Approximately  one hour later,  the President 
tweeted, "So many people are asking why isn't the A.G.  or Special Council looking at the many 
Hillary Clinton or Corney crimes.  33,000 e-mails deleted?"644  Later that morning, while aboard 
Marine One on the way to Norfolk, Virginia, the President told Priebus that he had to get Sessions 
to resign immediately.645  The President said that the country had lost confidence in  Sessions and 
the negative publicity was not tolerable.646  According to contemporaneous notes taken by Priebus, 
the President told Priebus to say that he "need[ ed] a letter of resignation on [his] desk immediately" 
and that Sessions had " no choice" but "must immediately resign."647  Priebus replied that if they 
fired Sessions, they would never get a new Attorney General confirmed and that the Department 
of Justice and Congress would turn  their backs on the President,  but the President suggested he 
could make a recess appointment to replace Sessions.648 

Priebus  believed  that the  President's request  was a  problem,  so  he  called McGahn  and 
asked  for advice,  explaining that he did  not want to  pull  the trigger on something that was  "all 
wrong."649  Although  the  President tied his  desire  for Sessions to  resign to Sessions's negative 
press  and  poor  performance  in  congressional  testimony,  Priebus  believed  that  the  President's 
desire  to  replace  Sessions  was  driven  by  the  President's  hatred  of Sessions' s  recusal  from  the 
Russia  investigation.650  McGahn told Priebus  not to follow the  President's order and  said they 
should consult their personal counsel, with whom they had attorney-client privilege.65 1  McGahn

and Priebus discussed the possibility that they would both have to resign rather than carry out the 
President's order to fire Sessions.652 

That  afternoon,  the  President  followed  up  with  Priebus  about  demanding  Sessions's 
resignation, using words to the effect of, "Did you get it?  Are you working on it?"653  Priebus said 
that he  believed  that  his job  depended  on  whether  he  followed  the  order to  remove  Sessions, 
although the President did not directly say so.654  Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out 
the President's directive, he told the President he would get Sessions to resign.655  Later in the day, 
Priebus called the President and explained that it would be a calamity if Sessions resigned because 
Priebus expected that Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign 
and the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed.656  The President agreed to hold 
off on demanding Sessions's resignation until after the Sunday shows the next day, to prevent the 
shows from focusing on the firing.657 

By the end of that weekend, Priebus recalled that the President relented and agreed not to 
ask Sessions to resign.658  Over the  next several days, the President tweeted about Sessions.  On 
the  morning  of Monday,  July  24,  2017,  the  President  criticized  Sessions  for  neglecting  to 
investigate Clinton and called him "beleaguered."659  On July 25, the President tweeted, "Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions has taken a  VERY weak position on  Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E(cid:173)
mails &  DNC server) &  Intel leakers!"660  The following day, July 26, the President tweeted, " Why 
didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Corney friend  who was in 
charge of Clinton investigation."661  According to Hunt, in  light of the  President's frequent public 
attacks, Sessions prepared another resignation letter and for the rest of the year carried it with him 
in his pocket every time he went to the White House.662

U.S. Department of Justice 

Analysis 

In  analyzing  the  President's  efforts  to  have  Lewandowski  deliver  a  message  directing 
Sessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future 
election interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive  act.  The  President's  effort  to  send  Sessions  a  message  through 
Lewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the  investigation 
and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry. 

The  President  sought  to  have  Sessions  announce  that  the  President  "shouldn't  have  a 
Special Prosecutor/Counsel"  and that Sessions was going to "meet with the Special Prosecutor to 
explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with  investigating election 
meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections."  The President wanted 
Sessions to disregard his recusal  from the investigation,  which had followed from  a formal  DOJ 
ethics  review, and have Sessions declare that he  knew "for a  fact"  that "there were  no Russians 
involved with the campaign" because he "was there."  The President further directed that Sessions 
should explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation " because he hasn't done 
anything  wrong."  Taken  together,  the  President's directives  indicate  that  Sessions  was  being 
instructed  to tell  the  Special Counsel  to end the  existing  investigation into  the President and  his 
campaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to "move forward with investigating election 
meddling for future elections." 

b. 

Nexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by the time of the President's 
initial  one-on-one  meeting  with Lewandowski  on  June  19,  2017, the existence of a  grand jury 
investigation  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  ublic  knowled  e.  B 
the  time  of the 
President's  follow-u  meetin  with  Lewandowski, 

See Volume II, Section 11.G, infra.  To satisfy the nexus requirement, 
it  would  be necessary to show that limiting the Special  Counsel's  investigation  would have the 
natural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding. 

c. 

Intent.  Substantial  evidence indicates that the  President's effort to have Sessions 
limit the scope of the Special Counsel's investigation to future election interference was intended 
to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President' s and his campaign's conduct. 

As  previously described, see Volume TT,  Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the 
Russia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian 
interference to cast doubt on the  legitimacy of his election.  The President further knew that the 
investigation  had broadened to  include  his  own conduct and  whether he  had obstructed justice. 
Those investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel's jurisdiction were limited to future 
election interference only. 

The  timing and  circumstances  of the  President's  actions  support the  conclusion that he 
sought that result.  The President's initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel's 
investigation  came just two days  after  the  President had  ordered  McGahn  to  ~ave  the  Special 
Counsel removed,  which  itself followed  public  reports that the  President was  persona lly  under

U.S. Department of Justice 

investigation for obstruction of justice.  The sequence of those events raises an inference that after 
seeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign's 
conduct from the investigation' s scope.  The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again 
on July  19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between 
Russians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media 
coverage and investigative interest. 

The manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent.  Rather 
than rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office.  The 
President selected a  loyal  "devotee"  outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting 
an  inference that he  was  working outside  White House channels,  including McGahn,  who  had 
previously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel.  The President 
also did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no 
cause to remove the Special Counsel.  Instead, the President tried to use  Sessions to  restrict and 
redirect the  Special Counsel's investigation  when  Sessions was recused  and  could  not  properly 
take any action on it. 

The July  19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President's intent.  The President 
followed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated 
the message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request.  And just hours after 
Lewandowski  assured  the  President that  the  message would  soon  be  delivered  to  Sessions,  the 
President  gave  an  unplanned  interview to  the  New  York Times  in  which  he  publicly attacked 
Sessions  and  raised  questions  about  his job  security.  Four  days  later,  on  July  22,  2017,  the 
President directed Priebus to obtain Sessions's resignation.  That evidence could raise an inference 
that the  President wanted  Sessions  to  realize  that  his job might  be on the  line  as  he  evaluated 
whether  to  comply  with  the  President's  direction  that  Sessions  publicly  announce  that, 
notwithstanding his recusal, he was going to confine the Special Counsel's investigation to future 
election interference. 

G. 

The President's Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 
Meeting Behveen Russians and Senior Campaign Officials 

Overview 

By June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting 
between senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory  information on Hillary 
Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."  On multiple occasions 
in  late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to  publicly disclose the emails, 
and he then dictated  a statement about the meeting to  be  issued by Donald Trump Jr.  describing 
the meeting as about adoption. 

Evidence 

I.  The President Learns About the Existence of Emails  Concerning  the  June 9, 

2016 Trump Tower Meeting 

In  mid-June 2017-

the  same week that the  President first  asked Lewandowski  to  pass  a 
senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during 

message to Sessions-

the campaign arranging a meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and 
a Russian attorney.663  As described in Volume I, Section TV.A.5, supra, the emails stated that the 
"Crown  [P]rosecutor of Russia" had offered "to provide the Trump campaign with some official 
documents and  information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia"  as part 
of "Russia and  its government's support for Mr. Trump."664  Trump Jr. responded, "[I]f it's what 
you say I  love it,"665  and he,  Kushner, and Manafort met with the Russian attorney and several 
other Russian individuals at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.666  At the meeting, the Russian attorney 
claimed that funds  derived  from  illegal activities  in Russia were provided to Hillary Clinton and 
other Democrats, and the Russian attorney then spoke about the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. statute 
that imposed financial and travel sanctions on Russian officials and that had resulted in a retaliatory 
ban in Russia on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.667 

According to written answers submitted by the President in response to questions from this 
Office, the President had no recollection of learning of the meeting or the emails setting it up at the 
time the meeting occurred or at any other time before the election.668 

The Trump Campaign had  previously received a document request from  SSCI that called 
for the production of various information,  including, "[a]  list and a description of all  meetings" 
between  any "individual  affiliated  with  the  Trump  campaign" and "any  individual  formally  or 
informally affiliated with the Russian government or Russian business interests which took place 
between  June  16,  2015,  and  12  pm  on  January  20,  2017,"  and  associated  records.669  Trump 
Organization attorneys became aware of the  June 9  meeting no  later than the first week of June 
2017,  when  they  began  interviewing  the  meeting  participants,  and  the  Trump  Organization 
attorneys provided the emails setting up the meeting to the President's personal counsel.670  Mark 
Corallo, who had been hired as a spokesman for the President's personal legal team, recalled that 
he learned about the June 9 meeting around June 21  or 22, 201 7. 671  Priebus recalled learning about 
the June 9  meeting from  Fox News host Sean Hannity in late June 2017.672  Priebus notified one

of the President's personal attorneys,  who told Priebus he was already working on it.673  By late 
June, several advisors recalled receiving media inquiries that could relate to the June 9 meeting.674 

2.  The  President  Directs  Communications  Staff  Not  to  Publicly  Disclose 

Information About the June 9 Meeting 

Communications  advisors  Hope  Hicks  and  Josh  Raffel  recalled  discussing  with  Jared 
Kushner and  Ivanka Trump that the emails  were  damaging and would  inevitably  be  leaked.675 
Hicks and Raffel advised that the best strategy was to proactively release the emails to the press.676 
On  or  about  June  22,  2017,  Hicks  attended  a  meeting  in  the  White  House  residence  with  the 
President, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump.677  According to Hicks, Kushner said that he wanted to fill 
the President in  on something that had been discovered in the documents he was to provide to the 
congressional  committees  involving a  meeting  with  him,  Manafort,  and Trump  Jr.678  Kushner 
brought a  folder  of documents to  the  meeting and  tried  to show them  to  the President,  but the 
President stopped Kushner and said he did not want to know about it,  shutting the conversation 
down.679 

On June 28, 2017, Hicks viewed the emails at Kushner' s attorney's office.680  She recalled 
being  shocked by the  emails  because  they  looked  "really  bad."681  The next day,  Hicks spoke 
privately with the President to mention her concern about the emai ls, which she understood were 
soon going to be shared with Congress.682  The President seemed upset because too many people 
knew about the emails and he told Hicks that just one lawyer should deal with the matter.683  The 
President indicated that he did not think the emails would leak, but said they would leak if everyone 
had access to them.684

Later that day, Hicks, Kushner, and Ivanka Trump went together to talk to the President.685 
Hicks recalled that Kushner told the President the June 9 meeting was not a big deal and was about 
Russian adoption, but that emails existed setting up the meeting.686  Hicks said she wanted to get 
in front of the story and have Trump Jr.  release the emails as  part of an  interview with "softball 
questions."687  The President said he did not want to  know about it and they should not go to the 
press.688  Hicks  warned  the President that  the  emails were "really bad"  and  the story would  be 
"massive" when it broke, but the President was insistent that he did not want to talk about it and 
said he did not want details.689  Hicks recalled that the President asked Kushner when his document 
production was due. 69° Kushner responded that it would be a couple of weeks and the President 
said, "then leave it alone."691  Hicks also recalled that the President said Kushner's attorney should 
give the emails to whomever he needed to give them to, but the President did not think they would 
be leaked to the press.692  Raffel later heard from Hicks that the President had directed the group 
not to be proactive in disclosing the emails because the President believed they would not leak.693 

3.  The  President  Directs  Trump  Jr.'s  Response  to  Press  Inquiries  About  the 

June 9 Meeting 

The  following  week,  the  President departed on  an  overseas  trip  for  the  G20  summit  in 
Hamburg, Germany, accompanied by Hicks, Raffel, Kushner, and Tvanka Trump, among others.694 
On July 7,  2017, while the President was overseas, Hicks and Raffel  learned that the New York 
Times was working on a story about the June 9 meeting.695  The next day, Hicks told the President 
about the story and he directed her not to comment.696  Hicks thought the President's reaction was 
odd because he usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.697  Later that 
day, Hicks and the President again spoke about the story.698  Hicks recalled that the President asked

her what the meeting had been about, and she said that she had been told the meeting was about 
Russian adoption.699  The President responded, "then just say that."700 

On the flight home from the G20 on July 8, 2017, Hicks obtained a draft statement about 
the meeting to  be  released by Trump Jr.  and  brought it to the President.701  The draft statement 
began  with  a  reference  to  the  information  that  was  offered  by  the  Russians  in  setting  up  the 
meeting: "I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe 
pageant with an  individual  who I was told might have  information  helpful  to  the  campaign."702 
Hicks again wanted to disclose the entire story, but the President directed that the statement not be 
issued because it said too much.703  The President told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief 
meeting  and  it was about Russian adoption.704  After speaking with  the President, Hicks texted 
Trump Jr. a revised statement on the June 9 meeting that read: 

It was a short meeting.  I asked Jared and Paul to stop by.  We discussed a  program about 
the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years 
ago and was since ended by the Russian  government,  but it was not a  campaign issue at 
that time and there was no follow up. 705 

Hicks' s text concluded,  "Are you ok with  this?  Attributed to you."706  Trump Jr.  responded  by 
text message that he wanted to add the word "primarily" before "discussed" so that the statement 
would read, "We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children."707  Trump 
Jr. texted that he wanted the change because "[t]hey started with some Hillary thing which was bs 
and some other nonsense which we shot down fast. "708  Hicks texted back, "I think that's right too 
but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions[.)  [U]ltimately [d]efer to you and [your attorney] 
on that word Be I know it's important and I think the mention of a campaign issue adds something 
to it in case we have to go further." 709  Trump Jr. responded, "lfl don't have it in there it appears

the  word "primarily" and  making  other minor additions-was  then  provided  to the New York 
Times.711  The full statement provided to the Times stated: 

It was  a  short  introductory  meeting.  I  asked Jared  and  Paul  to  stop  by.  We  primarily 
discussed a  program about the  adoption of Russian children that was active and  popular 
with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it 
was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.  I was asked to attend the 
meeting by an  acquaintance,  but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting 
with beforehand.712 

The statement did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton or any discussion 
of the  Magnitsky  Act  or U.S.  sanctions,  which  were  the  principal  subjects  of the  meeting,  as 
described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. 

A  short while later, while still  on Air Force One,  Hicks learned that Priebus  knew about 
the emails, which further convinced her that additional information about the June 9 meeting would 
leak and the White House should be proactive and get in front of the story.713  Hicks recalled again 
going to the President to urge him that they should be fully transparent about the June 9 meeting, 
but he again said no, telling Hicks, "You've given a statement.  We're done."7 14 

Later on the flight home, Hicks went to the President's cabin, where the President was on 
the phone with one of his  personal attorneys.715  At one point the President handed the phone to 
Hicks, and the attorney told Hicks that he had been working with Circa News on a separate story, 
and that she should not talk to the New York Times. 716 

4.  The Media Reports on the June 9, 2016 Meeting 

Before the President's flight home from  the G20 landed, the New York Times published 
its story about the June 9, 2016 meeting.717  In addition to the statement from Trump Jr., the Times 
story also quoted a statement from Corallo on behalf of the President's legal team suggesting that 
the meeting might have been a setup by individuals working with the firm that produced the Steele 
reporting.718  Corallo  also  worked  with  Circa  News  on  a  story  published  an  hour  later  that

questioned  whether  Democratic  operatives  had  arranged  the  June  9  meeting  to  create  the 
appearance of improper connections between Russia and Trump family  members. 7 19  Hicks was 
upset about Corallo's public statement and called  him  that evening to  say the President had  not 
approved the statement.720 

The  next  day,  July  9,  2017,  Hicks  and  the  President  called  Corallo  together  and  the 
President criticized Corallo for the  statement he  had  released.721  Corallo  told  the President the 
statement had been authorized and further observed that Trump Jr. 's statement was inaccurate and 
that a document existed that would contradict it.722  Corallo said that he purposely used the term 
"document" to refer to the emails setting up the June 9 meeting because he did not know what the 
President knew about the emails.723  Corallo recalled that when he referred to the "document" on 
the call  with  the President, Hicks  responded that only a few  people had access to  it and  said "it 
will never get out."724  Corallo  took contemporaneous  notes  of the call  that say:  "Also mention 
existence of doc.  Hope says ' only a few people have it.  It will never get out."'725  Hicks later told 
investigators that she had no memory of making that comment and had always believed the emails 
would eventually be leaked,  but she might have been channeling the President on the  phone call 
because  it was clear to her throughout her conversations with  the President that he did not think 
the emaiis would leak.726 

On  July  11, 2017, Trump Jr.  posted redacted  images of the emails setting up the June  9 
meeting on Twitter; the New York Times reported that he did so "[a]fter being told that The Times 
was about  to  publish  the  content of the  emails."727  Later that day,  the  media reported  that  the 
President had been personally involved in preparing Trump Jr.'s initial statement to the New York 
Times  that  had  claimed  the  meeting  "primarily"  concerned  "a  program  about  the  adoption  of 
Russian children."728  Over the next several days, the President's personal counsel repeatedly and

inaccurately denied that the President played any role in drafting Trump Jr. 's statement.729  After 
consulting with  the  President on the  issue,  White  House Press Secretary  Sarah Sanders told the 
media that the President "certainly didn't dictate" the statement, but that "he weighed in,  offered 
suggestions like any father would do."730  Several months later,  the President's personal counsel 
stated  in  a  private communication to the Special Counsel's Office that "the President dictated a 
short but accurate  response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, 
Jr."731  The President later told the press that it was "irrelevant" whether he dictated the statement 
and said, "It's a statement to the New York Times .... That's not a statement to a  high tribunal of 
judges. " 732

interview, the President addressed  the  June  9, 2016 meeting and  said he "didn't know anything 
about the  meeting" at the time.734  The  President added, "As  I've  said-most other people,  you 
know, when they call up and say,  'By the way,  we have information on your opponent,'  I  think 
most politicians -
I  was just with a  lot of people,  they said  ... ,  'Who wouldn' t  have taken  a 
meeting like that?"'735 

Analysis 

In analyzing the President's actions regarding the disclosure of information about the June 

9 meeting, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  On at least three  occasions between June  29, 2017, and July 9, 
2017, the President directed Hicks and others not to publicly disclose information about the June 

729 See,  e.g., David Wright, Trump lawyer: President was aware of "nothing", CNN (July 12, 2017) 
(quoting the President's personal attorney as saying, "I wasn't involved in the statement drafting at all nor 
was  the President."); see also Good Morning America, ABC (July  12, 2017) ("The President didn't sign 
off on anything . .. . The President wasn't involved in that."); Meet the Press, NBC (July  16, 2017) ("I do 
want to be clear-the President was  not involved in the drafting of the statement.").

9, 2016 meeting between  senior campaign  officials and  a Russian attorney.  On June  29,  Hicks 
warned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were " really bad" and the story 
would  be "massive" when  it  broke,  but  the  President told  her and  Kushner to  "leave  it alone." 
Early on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about 
the June 9  meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though  Hicks said that the 
President usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.  Later that day, the 
President rejected Trump Jr. 's draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was 
with  "an  individual  who  I  was  told  might  have  information  helpful  to  the  campaign."  The 
President then  dictated  a  statement to  Hicks  that said  the  meeting was about Russian  adoption 
(which the President had twice been told was discussed at the  meeting).  The statement dictated 
by the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton. 

Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed 
at the press.  They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions, 
sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel. 
On May  17, 2017, the President's campaign received a document request from  SSCI that clearly 
covered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have 
been relevant to the Special Counsel' s investigation. 

But the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the  emails or 
other  information  about  the  June  9  meeting  from  being  provided  to  Congress  or  the  Special 
Counsel.  The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and 
prevent  their  public  release  occurred  in  the  context of developing  a  press  strategy.  The  only 
evidence ,we  have  of the  President  discussing  the  production  of documents  to  Congress  or  the 
Special  Counsel  is  the  conversation  on  June  29,  2017,  when  Hicks  recalled  the  President 
acknowledging that Kushner's attorney should  provide  emails related  to  the  June  9  meeting  to 
whomever he  needed to give them to.  We do not have evidence of what the President discussed 
with his own lawyers at that time. 

b. 

Nexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by the time of the President's 
attempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of 
a  grand  jury  investigation  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  public  knowledge,  and  the 
President had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries.  To satisfy the 
nexus  requirement,  however,  it would  be  necessary  to  show that  preventing  the  release of the 
emails  to  the  public  would  have  the  natural  and  probable  effect  of impeding  the  grand jury 
proceeding or congressional  inquiries.  As  noted above, the evidence does  not establish that the 
President sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in  those official proceedings. 

c. 

intent.  The  evidence  establishes  the  President's  substantial  involvement  in  the 
communications strategy related to information about his  campaign's connections to Russia and 
his desire to minimize  public disclosures about those connections.  The President became aware 
of the emails no  later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and 
he  could  have  been  aware  of them  as  early  as  June  2,  2017,  when  lawyers  for  the  Trump 
Organization began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting.  The President 
thereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information 
about the June 9 meeting.  The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the 
emails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter.  And the President 

106

U.S. Department of Justice 

dictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr.  in response to the first press accounts of the June 
9  meeting that said the meeting was about adoption. 

But as  described  above,  the  evidence  does  not establish  that the  President  intended  to 
prevent the Special Counsel's Office or Congress from  obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 
meeting or other  information  about that meeting.  The  statement recorded  by Corallo-that the 
emails "will never get out"-can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be 
made public if the President's press strategy were followed, even  if the emails were provided to 
Congress and the Special Counsel. 

H. 

The President's Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the 
Investigation 

Overview 

From  summer  2017  through  2018,  the  President  attempted  to  have  Attorney  General 
Sessions  reverse  his  recusal,  take control  of the  Special  Counsel's  investigation,  and  order an 
investigation of Hillary Clinton. 

Evidence 

1.  The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal 

After  returning  Sessions's  resignation  letter  at  the  end  of May  2017,  but  before  the 
President's July  19, 2017 New York Times interview in  which he publicly criticized Sessions for 
recusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse 
his recusal.  In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel, 
Sessions  recalled,  the  President  called  him  at  home  and  asked  if Sessions  would  "unrecuse" 
himself. 736  According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions 
could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the "gist" 
of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from "all of it,"  including 
the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.737  Sessions listened but did  not respond,  and  he did 
not reverse his recusal or order an  investigation of Clinton.738 

In  early July  2017,  the President asked  Staff Secretary  Rob  Porter what he  thought of 
Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand.739  Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand 
was good,  tough,  and "on  the  team." 740  The President also  asked  if Porter thought Brand was 
interested in being responsible for the Special Counsel's investigation and whether she would want 

736  Sessions  I /17/18  302,  at  15.  That was  the  second  time  that the  President asked  Sessions  to 
reverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations.  See Volume II, Section 11.C.1, supra (describing 
President's March 2017 request at Mar-a-Lago for Sessions to unrecuse).

to be Attorney General one day.741  Because Pmter knew Brand, the President asked him to sound 
her  out  about  taking  responsibility  for  the  investigation  and  being  Attorney  General.742 
Contemporaneous notes taken by Porter show that the President told Porter to "Keep in touch with 
your friend," in  reference  to  Brand.743  Later, the President asked  Porter a  few times  in  passing 
whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable 
with the task. 744  In asking him to reach out to Brand, Porter understood the President to want to 
find  someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel,  although the President 
never  said  so  explicitly.745  Porter  did  not  contact  Brand  because  he  was  sensitive  to  the 
implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an 
effort to end the investigation or fire  the Special Counsel. 746 

McGahn recalled that during the summer of 201 7, he and the President discussed the fact 

that if Sessions were no longer in his position the Special Counsel would report directly to a non(cid:173)
recused Attorney General.747  McGahn told the President that things might not change much under 
a  new  Attorney  General.748  McGahn  also  recalled  that  in  or  around  July  2017,  the  President 
frequently brought up  his displeasure with Sessions.749  Hicks recalled that the President viewed 
Sessions's recusal from the Russia investigation as an act of disloyalty .750  In addition to criticizing 
Sessions's  recusal,  the President raised  other concerns  about Sessions and  his job performance 
with McGahn and Hicks.751 

741  Porter 4/13/ I 8 302, at 11; Porter 5/8/18 302, at 6.  Because of Sessions 's recusal, if Rosenstein 
were no longer in his position, Brand would, by default, become the DOJ official in charge of supervising 
the Special Counsel's investigation, and  if both Sessions and  Rosenstein were removed, Brand would be 
next in line to become Acting Attorney General for all  DOJ matters.  See 28 U.S.C. § 508.

2.  Additional Efforts to Have Sessions Unrecuse or Direct Investigations Covered 

by his Recusal 

Later  in  2017,  the  President  continued  to  urge  Sessions  to  reverse  his  recusal  from 
campaign-related investigations and considered replacing Sessions with an  Attorney General who 
would not be recused. 

On  October  16,  2017,  the  President  met  privately  with  Sessions  and  said  that  the 
Department of Justice was not investigating individuals and events that the President thought the 
Department should be investigating.752  According to contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, who 
was at the meeting, the President mentioned Clinton's emails and said, "Don't have to tell us, just 
take  [a]  look."753  Sessions  did  not offer any  assurances  or  promises to  the  President that  the 
Department of Justice would comply with that request. 754  Two days later,  on October 18, 2017, 
the President tweeted, "Wow, FBI confirms report that James Corney drafted  letter exonerating 
Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete.  Many people not interviewed, 
including Clinton herself.  Corney stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix?  Where 
is  Justice  Dept?" 755  On  October 29,  2017,  the  President  tweeted  that there  was  "ANGER  & 
UNITY"  over a  "lack of investigation"  of Clinton  arid  "the  Corney  fix,"  and  concluded: " DO 
SOMETHTNG!"756 

On December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with 
the Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end 
of a  cabinet meeting.757  During that Oval Office meeting,  which Porter attended, the  President 
again suggested that Sessions could " unrecuse," which Porter linked to taking back supervision of 
the  Russia  investigation  and  directing  an  investigation  of Hillary  Clinton.758  According  to 
contemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, "T  don't know if you could un-recuse 
yourself.  You'd be a  hero.  Not telling you  to  do anything.  Dershowitz says POTUS  can get 
involved.  Can order AG to investigate.  I don 't want to get involved.  I'm not going to get involved. 
I'm  not going  to  do  anything or direct you  to do anything.  I just want to  be treated  fairly."759 
According  to  Porter's  notes,  Sessions responded,  "We  are  taking steps;  whole  new  leadership

team.  Professionals;  will  operate  according  to  the  law."760  Sessions  also  said,  "I  never  saw 
anything that was improper," which Porter thought was noteworthy because it did not fit with the 
previous discussion about Clinton.761  Porter understood Sessions to  be reassuring the  President 
that he was on the President's team.762 

At the  end of December,  the  President told the New York Times  it was "too  bad" that 
Sessions had recused  himself from  the Russia investigation.763  When asked whether Holder had 
been a  more loyal  Attorney General to President Obama than Sessions was to him, the President 
said,  "I don ' t  want to  get into  loyalty,  but I  will  tell  you that,  I  will  say this:  Holder protected 
President Obama.  Totally protected him .  When you look at the things that they did, and Holder 
protected the president.  And (have great respect for that, I'll be honest."764  Later in January, the 
President brought up the idea ofreplacing Sessions and told Porter that he wanted to "clean house" 
at the Department of Justice.765  In a meeting in the White House residence that Porter attended on 
January 27, 2018, Porter recalled that the President talked about the great attorneys he had in the 
past with  successful win  records,  such as  Roy Cohn and  Jay Goldberg, and said that one of his 
biggest failings  as President was that he had  not surrounded himself with good attorneys,  citing 
Sessions as an example.766  The President raised Sessions's recusal and brought up and criticized 
the Special Counsel's investigation.767 

Over the next several months, the President continued to criticize Sessions in  tweets and 
media interviews and on several occasions appeared to publicly encourage him  to take action  in 
the  Russia  investigation  despite  his  recusal.768  On  June  5,  2018,  for  example,  the  President

should stop this Rigged  Witch  Hunt right now."770  On August 23,  2018, the  President publicly 
criticized  Sessions  in  a  press  interview  and  suggested  that  prosecutions  at  the  Department  of 
Justice were politically motivated because Paul Manafo11 had been prosecuted but Democrats had 
not.771  The President said, "I  put in an Attorney General that never took control of the  Justice 
Department, JeffSessions."772  That day, Sessions issued a press statement that said, "I took control 
of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in .... While I am Attorney General, the actions 
of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations." 773  The 
next  day,  the  President  tweeted  a  response:  '"Department  of Justice  will  not  be  improperly

On November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, the President replaced Sessions 

with Sessions's chief of staff as Acting Attorney General.775 

Analysis 

In analyzing the President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse himself and regain control 
of the Russia investigation, the following considerations and evidence are relevant to the elements 
of obstruction of justice: 

a.  Obstructive act.  To determine if the President' s  effo11s  to have the  Attorney General 
unrecuse could qualify as an obstructive act, it would be necessary to assess evidence on whether 
those  actions  would  naturally  impede  the  Russia  investigation.  That  inquiry  would  take  into 
account the  supervisory role that the  Attorney General,  if unrecused,  would  play  in  the  Russia 
investigation.  It also would have to take into account that the Attorney General's recusal covered 

("Jeff Sessions  should  be  ashamed  of himself for  allowing  this  total  HOAX  to  get started  in  the  first 
place!").

other campaign-related matters.  The inquiry would not tum on what Attorney  General  Sessions 
would actually do  if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to  reverse  his recusal would naturally 
have had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation. 

On  multiple  occasions  in  2017,  the  President  spoke with  Sessions  about  reversing  his 
recusal  so  that  he  could  take  over  the  Russia  investigation  and  begin  an  investigation  and 
prosecution  of Hillary  Clinton.  For  example,  in  early  summer  2017,  Sessions  recalled  the 
President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive.  When the President 
raised the issue again in  December 2017, the President said,  as recorded  by  Porter, "Not telling 
you to do anything ... .  I' m not going to get involved.  I' m not going to do anything or direct you 
to do anything.  I just want to  be treated fairly."  The duration of the President's efforts-which 
spanned from  March 2017 to  August 2018-and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized 
Sessions  in  public and  in  private for failing to tell  the President that he would have to recuse  is 
relevant to assessing whether the President' s  effotts to  have Sessions unrecuse  could qualify as 
obstructive acts. 

b.  Nexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence 
of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge.  In addition, 
in  July  2017,  a  different  grand jury  supervised  by  the  Special  Counsel  was  empaneled  in  the 
District of Columbia, and  the press  reported  on the existence of this grand jury in  early August 
2017.776  Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on 
those  proceedings  turns  on  much  of the  same  evidence  discussed  above  with  respect  to  the 
obstructive-act element. 

c.  Intent.  There  is evidence that at least one  purpose of the  President' s  conduct toward 
Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in  a 
way that would restrict its scope.  By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special 
Counsel  was  investigating  him  personally  for  obstruction  of justice.  And  in  the  wake  of the 
disclosures  of emails  about  the  June  9  meeting  between  Russians  and  senior members  of the 
campaign,  see  Volume  IT,  Section  TI.G,  supra,  it  was  evident  that  the  investigation  into  the 
campaign  now  included  the  President's  son,  son-in-law,  and  former  campaign  manager.  The 
President had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the 
Special  Counsel  investigation  would be  confined  to  future  election  interference.  Yet  Sessions 
remained recused.  In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to 
Sessions in  the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if 
he  unrecused.  Porter  linked  that  request  to  the  President's  desire  that  Sessions  take  back 
supervision  of the  Russia  investigation  and  direct  an  investigation  of Hillary  Clinton.  The 
President said  in  that meeting that he "just want[ ed]  to  be treated fairly," which could reflect  his 
perception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not.  But a 
principal  effect  of that  act  would  be  to  restore  supervision  of the  Russia  investigation  to  the 
Attorney  General-a  position  that  the  President  frequently  suggested  should  be  occupied  by 
someone  like  Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy,  who the  President described  as  protecting their

presidents.  A  reasonable  inference from  those statements and the President' s  actions  is  that the 
President believed  that an  unrecused  Attorney General  would  play  a  protective  role  and could 
shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation. 

I. 

The President Orders McGahn  to  Deny  that the President Tried to Fire the 
Special Counsel 

Overview 

In  late  January  2018,  the  media reported  that  in  June  2017  the  President  had  ordered 
McGahn to  have the Special Counsel fired  based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn 
had  refused,  saying  he  would  quit  instead.  After  the  story  broke,  the  President,  through  his 
personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove 
the Special Counsel.  Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute 
the  press accounts  because they were accurate in  reporting on the President's effort to  have the 
Special Counsel  removed.  The President later personally met with  McGahn in  the Oval Office 
with only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered 
him  to  fire  the  Special  Counsel.  McGahn  refused  and  insisted  his  memory of the  President' s 
In  that  same  meeting,  the  President 
direction  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel  was  accurate. 
challenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with  the President and asked why he had 
told Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed. 

Evidence 

I.  The Press Reports that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel 

On January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that  in  June 2017, the President had 
ordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel.777  According to the 
article, "[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a  possible 
obstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that 
disqualified him  from  overseeing the investigation."778  The  article  further  reported  that " [a]fter 
receiving the president's order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel ... refused to ask the 
Justice  Department to dismiss the  special counsel, saying he would quit instead."779  The article 
stated that  the  president "ultimately backed  down after  the  White  House counsel  threatened  to 
resign  rather  than  carry  out  the  directive."780  After  the  article  was  published,  the  President

dismissed the story when asked about it by reporters, saying, "Fake news,  folks.  Fake news.  A 
typical New York Times fake story."781 

The next day, the Washington Post reported on the same event but added that McGahn had 
not told the President directly that he intended to resign rather than carry out the directive to have 
the Special Counsel terminated.782  In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which 
could be read  to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his  intention to quit, causing the 
President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired. 783 

2.  The President Seeks to Have McGahn Dispute the Press Reports 

On January 26, 2018, the President's personal counsel called McGahn 's attorney and said 
that the President wanted McGahn to  put out a statement denying that he had  been asked to tire 
the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.784  McGahn's attorney spoke with 
McGahn about that request and then called the President's personal counsel to relay that McGahn 
would not make a statement.785  McGahn 's attorney informed the President's personal counsel that 
the  Times  story  was  accurate  in  reporting  that  the  President  wanted  the  Special  Counsel 
removed.786  Accordingly,  McGahn's attorney said, although  the  article  was inaccurate  in  some 
other respects,  McGahn  could  not comply with  the  President' s  request  to dispute  the  story.787 
Hicks recalled relaying to the President that one of his attorneys had spoken to McGahn' s attorney 
about the issue.788

White House Counsel Threatened to Quit, New York Times (Jan. 25, 2018). 

782  The Post article stated, "Despite internal objections, Trump decided to assert that Mueller had 
unacceptable conflicts of interest and  moved to remove him from  his position. . . .  In response, McGahn 
said he would not remain at the White House if Trump went through with the move ....  McGahn did not 
deliver  his  resignation  threat directly  to Trump but  was  serious about  his threat to leave."  Rosalind  S.

the story and was going to put out a statement.  Hicks 3/ 13/18 302, at  11.  But Kelly  said that he  did not 
speak to McGahn when the article came out and did  not tell anyone he had done so.  Kelly 8/2/18 302, at

Also  on  January  26,  2017,  Hicks  recalled  that  the President  asked  Sanders  to  contact 
McGahn about the story.789  McGahn told Sanders there was no need to respond and indicated that 
some of the  article was accurate.79° Consistent with  that  position, McGahn did  not correct the 
Times story. 

On February 4, 20 l 8, Priebus appeared  on  Meet the Press and  said he had not heard the 
President  say  that  he  wanted  the  Special  Counsel  fired.791  After  Priebus's  appearance,  the 
President called Priebus and said he did a great job on Meet the Press.792  The President also told 
Priebus that the President had "never said any of those things about" the Special Counsel.793 

The  next day,  on February  5, 2018, the  President  complained about the Times  article to 
Porter. 794  The  President  told  Porter that  the  article  was  "bullshit"  and  he  had  not  sought  to 
terminate the Special Counsel.795  The President said that McGahn leaked to the media to  make 
himselflook good.796  The President then directed Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make 
clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire  the Special Counsel.797  Porter thought the 
matter should be handled  by the White House communications office,  but the President said he 
wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file "for our records" and wanted something beyond a press 
statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate.798  The President referred to McGahn 
as a  "lying bastard" and said that he wanted a  record from  him .799  Porter recalled the President 

789  Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 11.  Sanders did  not recall  whether the President asked  her  to  speak to 

McGahn or if she did it on her own.  Sanders 7 /23/ 18 302, at 2.

President.  Porter 4/ 13/18 302, at 17.  Evidence indicates it was February 5, 2018.  On the back of a pocket 
card  dated February 5,  2018,  Porter took notes  that are consistent with  his description of the discussion: 
"COS: (1) Letter from  OM - Never threatened to quit- DJT never told him  to fire  M."  SC_RRP000053 
(Porter Undated Notes).  Porter said it was possible he took the notes on a day other than February 5.  Porter 
4/13/ 18 302, at 17.  But Porter also said that "COS" referred to matters he wanted to discuss with Chief of 
Staff Kelly, Porter 4/13/18 302, at 17, and Kelly took notes dated February 5, 2018, that state "POTUS -
Don McGahn letter - Mueller + resigning."  WH0000I 7684 (Kelly  2/5/18 Notes).  Kelly said he did not 
recall  what the notes  meant,  but thought the  President may  have "mused"  about having  McGahn write  a 
letter.  Kelly 8/2/18 302, at 3.  McGahn recalled that Poiter spoke with him about the  President's request 
about two weeks after the New York Times story was published, which is  consistent with the discussion 
taking place on or about February 5.  McGahn 3/8/18 302, at 4.

saying something to the  effect of, "If he doesn't write a  letter, then maybe I'll have to get rid of 
him."soo 

Later that day, Porter spoke to McGahn to deliver the President's message.801  Porter told 
McGahn that he had to write a  letter to dispute that he was ever ordered to terminate the Special 
Counsel.802  McGahn  shrugged  off the  request,  explaining that  the  media reports  were true.803 
McGahn told Porter that the President had  been  insistent on firing  the  Special  Counsel and that 
McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told 
the President he intended to quit.804  Porter told McGahn that the President suggested that McGahn 
would be fired ifhe did not write the letter.805  McGahn dismissed the threat, saying that the optics 
would be terrible if the President followed through with firing him on that basis. 806  McGahn said 
he would not write the letter the President had requested.807  Porter said that to his knowledge the 
issue ofMcGahn's letter never came up with the President again, but Porter did recall telling Kelly 
about his conversation with McGahn.808 

The next day,  on February 6, 2018, Kelly scheduled time  for McGahn to meet with  him 
and the President in the Oval Office to discuss the Times article.809  The morning of the meeting, 
the President's personal counsel called ,McGahn's attorney and said that the President was going 
to  be  speaking  with  McGahn  and  McGahn  could  not  resign  no  matter  what  happened  in  the 
meeting. 810 

The President began the Oval Office meeting by telling McGahn that the New York Times 
story did  not " look good" and McGahn needed  to  correct it.811  McGahn  recalled  the  President 
said, "I never said to fire Mueller.  I never said 'fire. '  This story doesn't look good.  You need to 
correct this.  You're the White House counsel."812

In  response,  McGahn  acknowledged  that he  had  not  told  the  President directly  that  he 
planned to resign, but said that the story was otherwise accurate.813  The President asked McGahn,  · 
"Did I  say the word  ' fire'?"814  McGahn responded, "What you said is,  ' Call Rod  [Rosenstein], 
tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel. "'8 15  The President responded, 
"I never said that." 81 6  The President said he  merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue 
with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do.81 7  McGahn told the President he did not 
understand  the  conversation  that  way  and  instead  had  heard,  " Call  Rod.  There  are  conflicts. 
Mueller has  to go." 818  The  President asked McGahn whether he would "do a  correction,"  and 
McGahn said no.819  McGahn thought the President was testing his mettle to see how committed 
McGahn was to what happened. 82° Kelly described the meeting as " a little tense."821 

The President also asked McGahn in  the meeting why he had told Special Counsel's Office 
investigators  that the President had  told  him  to have  the Special Counsel  removed. 822  McGahn 
responded  that  he  had  to  and that  his  conversations  with  the  President were  not  protected  by 
attorney-client privilege.823  The President then asked, "What-about these notes?  Why do you take 
notes?  Lawyers don' t take notes.  I never had a lawyer who took notes." 824  McGahn responded 
that he keeps notes because he  is a "real  lawyer"  and explained that notes create a  record and are 
not a bad thing.825  The President said, " I' ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn.  He did not 
take notes." 826 

After the Oval Office meeting concluded, Kelly recalled McGahn telling him that McGahn 
and the President " did have that conversation"  about removing the Special Counsel. 827  McGahn 
recalled that Kelly said that he had pointed out to the President after the Oval Office that McGahn

had not backed down and would not budge.828  Following the Oval Office meeting, the President's 
personal  counsel  called  McGahn' s  counsel  and  relayed  that  the  President  was '"fine"  with 
McGahn. 829 

Analysis 

In analyzing the President' s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to have 
the Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of 
justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  The President's repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record 
denying that the  President had directed  him  to  remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an 
obstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from  testifying truthfully or to 
undermine his credibility as a potential witness ifhe testified consistently with his memory, rather 
than with what the record said. 

There is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories 
were published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had 
never  told  McGahn  to  have  Rosenstein  remove  the  Special  Counsel.  The  President  correctly 
understood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign.  Tn addition, 
the President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and 
in  the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the President said, "I never said to fire Mueller.  I never 
said  'fire."'  That  evidence  could  indicate  that  the  President  was  not  attempting  to  persuade 
McGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own-but different-recollection of the 
substance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn's reaction to them. 

Other evidence cuts against that understanding of the President's conduct.  As previously 
described,  see  Volume IT, Section ILE,  supra,  substantial  evidence supports McGahn's account 
that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and 
context  of the President's directive; the manner in  which  McGahn reacted;  and the fact  that the 
President had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department 
of Justice,  and  should  be  raised  with  the  President's  personal  counsel  rather than  brought  to 
McGahn.  In addition,  the President's subsequent denials  that  he  had  told  McGahn to  have  the 
Special Counsel removed were carefully worded.  When first asked about the New York Times 
story, the President said, "Fake news, folks.  Fake news.  A typical New York Times fake story." 
And when the President spoke with McGahn  in  the  Oval Office,  he focused  on  whether he had 
used the word "fire,"  saying, "I never said to  fire  Mueller.  I never said ' fire"' and "Did T say the 
word  ' fire'?"  The  President's  assertion  in  the  Oval  Office meeting  that he  had  never directed 
McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence. 

Tn  addition, even if the President sincerely disagreed with McGahn's memory of the June 
17,  2017 events,  the  evidence  indicates  that  the  President knew by  the  time  of the  Oval  Office 

828  McGahn 3/8/18  302, at 5.  Kelly  did  not  recall  discussing the  Oval Office  meeting  with the 
President after the fact.  Kelly 8/2/1 8 302, at 2.  Handwritten notes taken by Kelly state, "Don[:]  Mueller

meeting that McGahn's account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views.  Shortly after the 
story broke, the President's counsel told McGahn 's counsel that the President wanted McGahn to 
make a statement denying he had been asked to fire  the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded 
through his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply 
with the President's request.  The President then directed Sanders to tell  McGahn to  correct the 
story, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in  reporting on the 
President's order.  Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction.  More than a 
week later,  the  President brought up the  issue again  with Porter,  made  comments indicating the 
President thought McGahn had  leaked  the  story,  and  directed  Porter to  have  McGahn  create  a 
record denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel.  At that point, the President 
said he might "have to get rid of' McGahn ifMcGahn did not comply.  McGahn again refused and 
told  Porter,  as  he  had told  Sanders and as  his counsel had told the  President's counsel,  that the 
President had in  fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel.  That evidence 
indicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not 
think the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying 
facts that McGahn believed to be true.  The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to 
repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate. 

b. 

Nexus to an official proceeding.  By January 2018, the Special Counsel ' s use of a 
grand jury had been further  confirmed  by the  return  of several  indictments.  The  President also 
was aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events because, among 
other  reasons,  on  January  8,  20 I 8,  the  Special  Counsel's Office  provided  his  counsel  with  a 
detailed  list  of topics  for  a  possible  interview with  the  President.830  The  President  knew that 
McGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and 
that McGahn had already  been interviewed by Special  Counsel  investigators.  And  in  the Oval 
Office  meeting,  the President indicated  he  knew that McGahn  had  told  the  Special  Counsel's 
Office  about  the  President's  effort  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel.  The  President  challenged 
McGahn  for  disclosing  that  information  and  for  taking  notes  that  he  viewed  as  creating 
unnecessary legal exposure.  That evidence indicates the President's awareness that the June  17, 
2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel's investigation and any grand jury investigation 
that might grow out ofit. 

To establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President's actions would have 
the natural tendency to affect such a  proceeding or that they would hinder, delay,  or prevent the 
communication of information to investigators.  Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel 
investigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior 
statements in  those interviews.  But because McGahn had repeatedly  spoken to  investigators and 
the obstruction inquiry was not complete,  it was foreseeable that he would  be  interviewed again 
on obstruction-related topics.  If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking 
to  have  McGahn  refute  the  New  York  Times  article,  a  nexus  to  a  proceeding  or  to  further 
investigative interviews would not be shown.  But the President's efforts to have McGahn write a 
letter "for our records" approximately ten days after the stories had come out- well past the typical 

830  1/29/ I 8  Letter,  President's  Personal  Counsel  to  Special  Counsel 's  Office,  at  1-2  ("In  our 
conversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with 
the President in order to complete your investigation on the subjects of alleged collusion and obstruction of 
justice"; listing  16 topics).

time  to issue  a correction for a  news story-indicates the  President was not focused  solely on a 
press  strategy,  but  instead  likely  contemplated  the  ongoing  investigation  and  any  proceedings 
arising from  it. 

c. 

Intent.  Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute 
that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of 
influencing  McGahn 's account in  order to deflect or prevent  further  scrutiny of the  President's 
conduct towards the investigation. 

Several  facts  support  that  conclusion.  The  President  made  repeated  attempts  to  get 
McGahn  to change his story.  As described above, by  the  time of the  last attempt, the  evidence 
suggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President 
had ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated.  McGahn interpreted his encounter with 
the President in the Oval Office as an  attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to 
his  memory of what had  occurred.  The President had already  laid  the  groundwork for pressing 
McGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to  fire McGahn if he did 
not deny  the story,  and Porter relayed  that  statement  to  McGahn.  Additional evidence  of the 
President's intent may  be  gleaned from  the  fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed  by  the 
prospect of the President's meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn ' s counsel and said that 
McGahn could not resign no matter what happened in  the Oval Office that day.  The President's 
counsel was well aware ofMcGahn's resolve not to  issue what he believed to be a false account 
of events despite the President's request.  Finally,  as  noted  above,  the  President brought  up  the 
Special  Counsel  investigation  in  his  Oval  Office  meeting with  McGahn  and criticized  him  for 
telling  this  Office  about  the  June  17,  2017  events.  The  President's  statements  reflect  his 
understanding-and his displeasure-that those  events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice 
inquiry. 

J. 

The President's Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort, ~ 

Overview 

In addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other 
actions  directed  at  possible witnesses  in  the  Special  Counsel's  investigation,  including Flynn, 
Manafort, 1;c•w■"nd as described in  the next section, Cohen.  When Flynn withdrew from a joint 
defense agreement with the President, the President' s personal counsel stated that Flynn's actions 
would be viewed as reflecting "hostility" towards the President.  During Manafort's prosecution 
and while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafott was bein  treated 
unfair!  and made it known that Mana fort could receive a  ardon. 

Evidence 

I .  Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn 

As  previously noted, see  Volume II,  Section 11.B, supra, the  President asked for Flynn's 
resignation  on February  13,  2017.  Following Flynn' s  resignation,  the President made  positive 
public comments about Flynn, describing him as a "wonderful man," "a fine person," and a "very

U.S. Department of Justice 

good person."831  The President also privately asked advisors to pass messages to Flynn conveying 
that the President still cared about him and encouraging him to stay strong. 832 

In late November 2017, Flynn began to cooperate with this Office.  On November 22, 2017, 
Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement he had with the President.833  Flynn's counsel told 
the President's personal counsel and counsel for the White House that Flynn could no longer have 
confidential  communications  with  the  White  House  or  the  President.834  Later  that  night,  the 
President's personal counsel left a  voicemail for Flynn's counsel that said: 

I  understand  your situation,  but  let  me see  if I  can't state  it  in starker terms. 
.  .  .  [I]t 
wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with ...  the government. ...  [I]f 
. .. there's information that  implicates the  President,  then  we've got  a  national  security 
issue,  . . .  so,  you know,  .  .  .  we need some kind of heads up.  Um, just for the sake of 
protecting all our interests ifwe can .... [R]emember what we've always said about the 
' President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains  .... 835 

On November 23, 2017, Flynn's attorneys returned the call  from the President's personal 
counsel to acknowledge receipt of the voicemail.836  F ly nn 's attorneys reiterated that they were no 
longer in  a  position to  share  information  under  any sort of privilege.837  According  to  Flynn' s 
attorneys, the President's personal counsel was indignant and  vocal  in his disagreement.838  The 
President's personal counsel said that he interpreted what they said to him as a reflection ofFlynn's 

83 1  See,  e.g. , Remarks  by President  Trump  in  Press  Conference,  White  House  (Feb.  16,  2018) 
(stating that "Flynn  is  a fine  person" and "I don't think [Flynn] did anything wrong.  If anything,  he did 
something right . ..  You know, he was just doing his job"); Interview of Donald J  Trump, NBC (May  11 , 
2017) (stating that Flynn is  a "very good person"). 

832 See Priebus  I /18/17 302, at 9-10 (the President asked Priebus to contact Flynn the week he was 
terminated  to convey  that the  President sti ll  cared about him  and felt  bad  about what happened  to  him; 
Priebus thought the President did not want Flynn to have a problem with him); McFarland  12/22/ 17  302, 
at 18 (about a month or two after Flynn was terminated, the President asked McFarland to get in touch with 
Flynn and tell him that he was a good guy, he should stay strong, and the President felt bad for him); Flynn 
1/19/18 302, at 9 (recalling the call from Priebus and an additional call from Hicks who said she wanted to 
relay  on  behalf of the  President  that  the  President  hoped  Flynn  was  okay);  Christie  2/13/19  302,  at  3 
(describing a phone conversation between Kushner and Flynn the day after Flynn was fired where Kushner 
said, "You know the President respects you.  The President cares about you.  I' II  get the President to send 
out a positive tweet about you later," and the President nodded his assent to Kushner's comment promising 
a tweet).

hostility towards  the  President and that he  planned to  inform  his  client of that interpretation.839 
Flynn's attorneys understood that statement to be an attempt to make them reconsider their position 
because the President's personal counsel believed that Flynn would be disturbed to know that such 
a message would be conveyed to the President.840 

On  December  1,  2017,  Flynn  pleaded  gui lty  to  making  false  statements  pursuant to  a 
cooperation agreement.841  The next day,  the President told  the  press that he was not concerned 
about what Flynn might tell the Special Counsel.842  In response to a  question about whether the 
President still stood behind Flynn, the President responded, "We'll see what happens."843  Over 
the next several  days,  the President made  public  statements expressing sympathy for Flynn  and 
indicating he had not been treated fairly.844  On December 15, 2017, the President responded to a 
press inquiry about whether he was considering a pardon for Flynn by saying, "I don't want to talk 
about pardons for Michael Flynn yet.  We'll see what happens.  Let's see.  I can  say this:  When 
you look at what' s  gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very,  very 
angry."845 

2.  Conduct Directed at Paul Manafort 

On October 27, 2017, a grand jury in the District of Columbia indicted Manafort and former

counts. 846  The charges in both cases alleged criminal conduct by Manafort that began as early as 
2005 and continued through 2018.847 

In January 2018, Manafort told Gates that he had talked to the President's personal counsel 
and they were "going to take care of us."848  Mana fort told Gates it was stupid to plead, saying that 
he had been in touch with the President's personal counsel and repeating that they should " sit tight" 
and "we'll be taken care of."849  Gates asked Manafort outright if anyone mentioned pardons and 
Manafort said no one used that word.850 

As the proceedings against Manafort progressed in court, the President told Porter that he 
never liked Manafort and that Manafort did not know what he was doing on the campaign.851  The 
President discussed with aides whether and in what way Manafort might be cooperating with the 
Special  Counsel's  investigation,  and  whether  Manafort  knew  any  information  that  would  be 
harmful to the President. 852 

In  public,  the  President  made statements criticizing the prosecution and  suggesting that 
Manafort was being treated unfairly.  On June I 5, 2018, before a scheduled court hearing that day 
on whether Manafort's bail should be revoked based on new charges that Manafort had tampered 
with  witnesses  while out on bail,  the President told the press,  "T  feel  badly about a  lot of them

badly about it.  They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago?  ...  I feel  badly 
for some people, because they've gone back  12 years to find things about somebody, and I don't 
think  it' s  right."853 
In  response  to  a  question  about whether  he  was  considering a  pardon  for 
Manafort or other individuals involved in the Special Counsel's investigation, the President said, 
"I don't want to talk about that.  No, I don't want to talk about that. ... But look, I do want to see 
people treated fairly.  That's what it's all about." 854  Hours later, Manafort's bail was revoked and 
the  President tweeted,  "Wow,  what a  tough  sentence  for  Paul  Manafort,  who  has  represented 
Ronald  Reagan,  Bob  Dole  and  many  other top  political  people  and campaigns.  Didn't know 
Manafort was the head of the Mob.  What about Corney and Crooked Hillary and all  the others? 
Very unfair!"855 

Immediately following the revocation ofManafort' s bail, the President's personal lawyer, 
Rudolph  Giuliani,  gave a  series of interviews  in  which he raised  the  possibility of a  pardon  for 
Manafort.  Giuliani told the New York Daily News that "[w]hen the whole thing is over, things 
might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons." 856  Giuliani also said in an  interview that, 
although the President should  not  pardon anyone while the Special Counsel's investigation  was 
ongoing,  " when the  investigation  is  concluded,  he's kind  of on  his  own,  right?"857 
In  a  CNN 
interview two days later,  Giuliani said, " I guess I  should  clarify this once and  for all.  . .  .  The 
president has issued no pardons in  this  investigation.  The president is not going to issue pardons 
in  this investigation .... When it' s over, hey, he's the president of the United States.  He retains 
his pardon power.  Nobody is taking that away from him."858  Giuliani rejected the suggestion that 
his and the President's comments could signal to defendants  that they should  not cooperate  in  a 
criminal  prosecution  because a  pardon  might follow,  saying the  comments were "certainly  not 
intended that way."859  Giuliani said the comments only acknowledged that an individual involved 
in the investigation would not be "excluded from [ a pardon], if in fact the president and his advisors 
.. .  come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly."860  Giuliani observed that pardons 
were not unusual  in political investigations but said, "That doesn't mean they're going to happen

On  July  31,  2018,  Manafort's  criminal  trial  began  in  the  Eastern  District  of Virginia, 
generating substantial news coverage. 862  The next day, the President tweeted, "This is a  terrible 
situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before 
it continues to stain our country any further.  Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his  17 Angry 
Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a  disgrace to USA!"863  Minutes later,  the President 
tweeted, "Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent 
and respected political leaders.  He worked for me for a very short time.  Why didn't government 
tell me that he was under investigation.  These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion-a 
Hoax!"864  Later in  the  day,  the  President tweeted, "Looking back  on  history,  who was treated 
worse,  Alfonse  Capone,  legendary  mob  boss,  killer  and  'Public Enemy Number One,'  or Paul 
Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement- although 
convicted  of nothing?  Where  is  the  Russian  Collusion?"865  The  President's tweets  about the 
Manafort trial  were  widely covered by the  press.866  When asked about the  President's  tweets, 
Sanders told  the  press, "Certainly,  the President's been clear.  He  thinks  Paul Manafort's  been 
treated unfairly."867 

On August 16, 2018, the Manafort case was submitted to the jury and deliberations began. 
At that time,  Giuliani  had  recently suggested to reporters that the  Special Counsel  investigation 
needed to be "done in the next two or three weeks,"868  and media stories reported that a Manafort 
acquittal would add to criticism that the Special Counsel investigation was not worth the time and 
expense,  whereas a  conviction could  show that ending the  investigation  would be premature. 869

On August  17, 2018, as jury deliberations continued, the President commented on the trial  from 
the  South  Lawn  of the  White  House. 
In  an  impromptu  exchange  with  reporters  that  lasted 
approximately  five  minutes,  the  President  twice  called  the  Special  Counsel's  investigation  a 
"rigged witch hunt."870  When asked whether he would pardon Manafort if he was convicted, the 
President said, "I don't talk about that now.  I don' t talk about that."871  The President then added, 
without being asked a further question, "I think the whole Manafort trial is very sad when you look 
at what's going on there.  I think it's a very sad day for our country.  He worked for me for a very 
short period of time.  But you know what, he happens to be a very good person.  And l  think it's 
very sad what they've done to Paul Manafort."872  The President did not take further questions.873 
In  response  to  the  President's  statements,  Manafort's  attorney  said,  "Mr.  Manafort  really 
appreciates the support of President Trump."874 

On  August  21 ,  2018,  the jury found  Manafort  guilty  on  eight  felony  counts.  Also  on 
August  21 ,  Michael  Cohen  pleaded  guilty  to  eight  offenses,  including  a  campaign-finance 
violation that he said had occurred "in coordination with,  and at the direction of,  a candidate for 
federal  offtce."875  The President reacted to Manafort' s  convictions that day by telling reporters, 
"Paul  Manafort' s  a  good  man"  and  "it's  a  very  sad  thing  that  happened."876  The  President 
described the Special Counsel's investigation as "a witch hunt that ends in disgrace." 877  The next 
day, the President tweeted, " I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family.  ' Justice' 
took a  12 year old tax case, among other things,  applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike 
Michael Cohen, he refused to  ' break'-make up stories in order to get a  'deal.'  Such respect for 
a brave man!"878 

In a  Fox News interview on August 22, 2018, the President said:  " [Cohen] makes a better 
deal  when  he uses me, like everybody else.  And one of the reasons l  respect Paul Manafort so 
much is he went through that trial- you know they make up stories.  People make up stories.  This

whole thing about flipping,  they  call  it,  T know all  about  flipping."879  The President said  that 
flipping  was "not fair"  and "almost ought to be outlawed."880 
ln response to a  question about 
whether he  was considering a  pardon for Manafort,  the President said, "T have great respect for 
what he's done, in terms of what he's gone through .... He worked for many, many people many, 
many  years,  and  T would  say  what  he  did,  some  of the  charges they  threw against him,  every 
consultant,  every  lobbyist  in  Washington  probably  does."88 1  Giuliani  told journalists  that  the 
President "really thinks  Manafort has  been horribly  treated"  and  that he and  the President  had 
discussed the political fallout  if the President pardoned Manafort.882  The next day,  Giuliani told 
the  Washington  Post that the  President had asked  his lawyers for  advice  on the possibility of a 
pardon for Manafort and other aides, and had been counseled against considering a  pardon  until 
the investigation concluded.883 

On September  14,  2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to  charges  in  the District of Columbia 
and signed a  plea agreement that required him to cooperate with  investigators.884  Giuliani  was 
reported  to  have  publicly  said  that  Manafort  remained  in  a  joint defense  agreement  with  the 
President  following  Manafort's  guilty  plea  and  agreement  to  cooperate,  and  that  Manafort's 
attorneys  regularly  briefed  the  President' s  lawyers  on  the  topics  discussed  and  the  information 
Manafort had provided in interviews with the Special Counsel's Office.885  On November 26, 2018, 
the Special Counsel's Office disclosed in a public court filing that Manafort had breached his plea 
agreement by lying about multiple subjects.886  The next day, Giuliani said that the President had 
been "upset for weeks" about what he considered to  be "the un-American,  horrible treatment of

U.S. Department of Justice 

Analysis 

In  analyzing the President's conduct towards  Flynn,  Manafort, litlllll, the following 

evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: 

a. 

Obstructive act.  The President's actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel's 
investigation  would  qualify as obstructive if they had the natural  tendency to  prevent particular 
witnesses from  testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing, 
delaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement. 

With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging 
him  to  stay  strong  and  conveying  that  the  President  still  cared  about  him  before  he  began  to 
cooperate  with  the  government.  When  Flynn's attorneys  withdrew  him  from  a  joint  defense 
agreement  with  the  President,  signaling  that  Flynn  was  potentially  cooperating  with  the 
government, the President's personal counsel initially reminded Flynn's counsel of the President's 
warm feelings  towards Flynn and said "that still  remains."  But when Flynn's counsel  reiterated 
that Flynn  could  no  longer  share  information  under a joint defense  agreement,  the  President's 
personal  counsel  stated  that  the  decision  would  be  interpreted  as  reflecting  Flynn's  hostility 
towards the  President.  That sequence of events could  have  had  the  potential  to  affect  Flynn's 
decision  to  cooperate,  as  well  as  the  extent  of that  cooperation.  Because  of privilege  issues, 
however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about 
the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel. 

With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President's actions had the potential to 
influence Manafort's decision whether to cooperate with the government.  The President and his 
personal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Mana fort, 
while also making it clear that the  President did  not want Manafort to "flip" and cooperate with 
the government.  On June  15, 2018,  the  day the judge presiding over Manafort's D.C.  case was 
considering whether to revoke  his  bail,  the President said  that he "felt badly" for Manafort and 
stated,  "I think  a  lot  of it  is  very  unfair."  And  when  asked about a  pardon  for  Manafort,  the 
President said, "I do want to see people treated fairly.  That's what it's all about."  Later that day, 
after  Manafort's  bail  was  revoked,  t.he  President  called  it  a  " tough  sentence"  that  was "Very 
unfair!"  Two days  later,  the President' s  personal counsel  stated  that individuals  involved  in the 
Special Counsel' s investigation could receive a  pardon " if in fact the [P]resident and his advisors 
.. . come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly"-using language that paralleled 
how the President had already described the treatment ofManafort.  Those statements, combined 
with the President's commendation ofManafort for being a "brave man" who " refused to ' break'," 
suggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Mana fort continued not to cooperate with 
the  government.  And  while  Manafort  eventually  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation 
agreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to investigators. 

The  President' s  public  statements  during  the  Manafort  trial,  including  during  jury 
deliberations,  also  had the  potential  to  influence the  trial jury.  On  the second  day  of trial,  for 
example, the President called the prosecution a "terrible situation"  and a " hoax" that "continues to 
stain our country"  and referred to Manafort as a "Reagan/Dole darling" who was "serving solitary 
confinement" even though he was "convicted of nothing."  Those statements were widely picked 
up by the press.  While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case and 

131 

Al:t:erHc,·  Werk Preauet // May CeHtaiH Material Preteetea UHaer Fea. R. Criffi. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

are  presumed  to  follow those  instructions,  the President's  statements during the  trial  generated 
substantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements 
or learned about them from others.  And the President' s statements during jury deliberations that 
Manafort "happens to  be a  very  good person" and that "it's very sad what they've done to Paul 
Mana fort" had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which the President 
made just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort. 

b. 

Nexus to an official proceeding.  The President's actions towards Flynn, Manafort, 
- - appear to have been connected to pending or ~d  official proceedings involving 
each individual.  The President's conduct towards Flynn~ principally occurred when both 
were under criminal  investigation  by the Special Counsel's  Office  and  press reports speculated 
about whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel's investigation.  And the President's 
conduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him.  The 
President made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort's criminal 
trial.  And the President's comments about the prospect of Manafort "flipping" occurred when it 
was clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings. 

c. 

Intent.  Evidence concerning the President's intent related to  Flynn as a  potential 
witness is inconclusive.  As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have evidence 
establishing whether the President knew about or was involved  in  his counsel' s communications 
with Flynn's counsel stating that Flynn's decision to withdraw from  the joint defense agreement 
and  cooperate  with  the  government  would  be  viewed  as  reflecting  "hostility"  towards  the 
President.  And regardless of what the President' s personal counsel communicated, the President 
continued  to  express  sympathy  for  Flynn  after  he  pleaded  guilty  pursuant  to  a  cooperation 
agreement,  stating  that Flynn had "led a  very strong life"  and the  President "fe[lt]  very badly" 
about what had happened to him. 

Evidence concerning the President's conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President 
intended  to encourage  Manafort to  not  cooperate  with  the  government.  Before  Manafort  was 
convicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly.  One day  after 
Manafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced  a  lengthy prison  term,  the 
President said that Manafort was "a brave man" for refusing to "break" and that "flipping" "almost 
ought to  be outlawed."  At the same time, although  the President had privately told aides he  did 
not like Manafort, he publicly called Mana fort "a good man" and said he had a " wonderful family." 
And  when  the  President  was  asked  whether  he  was  considering  a  pardon  for  Manafort,  the 
President did  not respond  directly  and  instead said he had "great respect for what [Manafort]'s 
done,  in  terms of what he's gone through."  The President added that "some of the charges they 
threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in  Washington probably does."  In light of the 
President's counsel's previous statements that the investigations "might get cleaned up with some 
presidential  pardons"  and  that  a  pardon  would  be  possible  if the  President  "come[s]  to  the 
conclusion  that  you  have  been  treated  unfairly,"  the  evidence  supports  the  inference  that  the

President  intended  Manafort  to  believe  that  he  could  receive  a  pardon,  which  would  make 
cooperation with the government as a means of obtaining a lesser sentence unnecessary. 

We also examined the evidence of the President's intent in making public statements about 
Manafort at the beginning of his trial and when the jury was deliberating.  Some evidence supports 
a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury.  The trial generated 
widespread publicity, and as the jury began to deliberate, commentators suggested that an acquittal 
would add to pressure to end the Special Counsel's investigation.  By publicly stating on the second 
day of deliberations that Manafort "happens to be a very good person" and that " it's very sad what 
they've done to Paul Manafort" right after calling the  Special Counsel 's  investigation a  "rigged 
witch hunt," the President' s statements could, if they reached jurors, have the natural tendency to 
engender sympathy  for  Manafort among jurors,  and  a  factfinder could  infer  that  the  President 
intended that result.  But there are alternative explanations for the President's comments, including 
that  he genuinely  felt  sorry  for Manafort  or that  his  goal  was  not  to  influence  the jury  but  to 
influence  public opinion.  The President's comments also  could have been  intended  to continue 
sending a  message  to  Manafort that a  pardon was possible.  As  described above,  the President 
made  his  comments about Manafort being "a very good person" immediately after declining to 
answer a question about whether he would pardon Manafort.

The President's Conduct Involving Michael Cohen 

Overview 

The  President's  conduct  involving  Michael  Cohen  spans  the  full  period  of  our 
investigation.  During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf 
of the  Trump  Organization.  Cohen  briefed  candidate  Trump  on  the  project  numerous  times, 
including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal.  After the media 
began questioning Trump' s  connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a  "party line"  that  publicly 
distanced Trump from  Russia and asserted he had no  business there.  Cohen continued to adhere 
to that party line  in  2017, when Congress asked him  to provide documents and  testimony in  its 
Russia  investigation.  [n  an  attempt  to  minimize  the President's connections  to  Russia,  Cohen 
submitted  a  letter to  Congress  falsely  stating that he only briefed Trump  on  the  Trump Tower 
Moscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen 
had not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project 
ended  in  January  2016,  before  the  first  Republican  caucus  or primary.  While  working on  the 
congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President' s personal counsel, 
who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the 
statement short and "tight."  After the FBI searched Cohen 's home and office in  April  2018, the 
President publicly asserted that Cohen would not "flip" and privately passed messages of support 
to him.  Cohen also discussed pardons with the  President's personal counsel and believed that if 
he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do "something else" to make 
the investigation end.  But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the 
President  publicly  criticized  him,  called  him  a  "rat,"  and  suggested  his  family  members  had 
committed crimes. 

Evidence 

1.  Candidate  Trump's  Awareness  of  and  Involvement  m  the  Trump  Tower 

Moscow Project 

The President's interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of 

the President's involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project. 

As described in  detail  in  Volume I,  Section IV.A. 1, supra, from September 2015 until at 
least June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project in Russia, with 
negotiations conducted by Cohen,  then-executive vice president of the  Trump Organization and 
special  counsel  to  Donald  J.  Trump.909 
The  Trump  Organization  had  previously  and 

909  In August 2018  and November  2018,  Cohen  pleaded  guilty to  multiple  crimes  of deception, 
including making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later 
in this section.  When Cohen first met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told 
Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project.  Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 12- 17.  But after Cohen pleaded 
guilty to offenses in the Southern District ofNew York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again 
and corrected the record.  The Office found Cohen's testimony  in  these subsequent proffer sessions to be 
consistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office's investigation. 
The Office's sentencing submission in Cohen's criminal case stated: "Starting with his second meeting with 
the [Special  Counsel's Office]  in  September 2018, the defendant has accepted  responsibility not only  for

unsuccessfully pursued a  building project in Moscow.910  According to Cohen, in approximately 
September 2015  he obtained internal approval from  Trump to negotiate on behalf of the Trump 
Organization to have a Russian corporation build a tower in Moscow that licensed the Trump name 
and brand.911  Cohen thereafter had numerous brief conversations with Trump about the project.912 
Cohen recalled that Trump wanted to be updated on any developments with Trump Tower Moscow 
and on several occasions brought the project up with Cohen to ask what was happening on it.913 
Cohen  also  discussed  the  project  on  multiple  occasions  with  Donald  Trump  Jr.  and  Ivanka 
Trump.914 

In  the fall  of 2015, Trump  signed a  Letter of Intent for  the project that specified highly 
lucrative terms for the Trump Organization.915  In December 2015, Felix Sater, who was handling 
negotiations  between  Cohen  and  the  Russian  corporation,  asked  Cohen  for  a  copy  of his  and 
Trump' s  passports to  facilitate  travel  to  Russia to  meet  with  government officials and  possible 
financing  partners.916  Cohen  recalled  discussing  the  trip with  Trump  and  requesting  a  copy of 
Trump's passport from Trump's personal secretary, Rhona Graff.917 

By January 2016, Cohen had become  frustrated  that Sater had  not set up a  meeting with 
Russian  government officials,  so  Cohen  reached  out  directly  by  email  to  the  office  of Dmitry 

his false  statements concerning the  [Trump Tower]  Moscow Project,  but also his broader efforts through 
public statements and testimony before Congress to minimize his role in, and what he knew about, contacts 
between  the  [Trump  Organization]  and  Russian  interests  during  the course  of the  campaign.  .  .  .  The 
information  provided  by  Cohen  about  the  [Trump  Tower]  Moscow  Project  in these  proffer sessions  is 
consistent with  and  corroborated  by  other  information  obtained  in the  course of the  [Special  Counsel's 
Office's]  investigation ....  The defendant,  without  prompting  by  the  [Special  Counsel's Office],  also 
corrected other false and misleading statements that he  had made concerning his outreach to and contacts 
with Russian officials during the course of the campaign."  Gov't Sentencing Submission at 4, United States

explained that Cohen had "provided valuable  information ... while taking care and being careful to  note 
what he knows and what he doesn't know."  Transcript at 19, United States v.  Michael Cohen,  I: l 8-cr-85O

the Trump Organization, including then-president of the organization Donald J.  Trump, pursued a Trump

Peskov, who was Putin's deputy chief of staff and press secretary.918  On January 20, 2016, Cohen 
received an email response from Elena Poliakova, Peskov's personal assistant, and phone records 
confirm that they then spoke for approximately twenty minutes, during which Cohen described the 
Trump Tower Moscow project and requested assistance in moving the project forward.919  Cohen 
recalled briefing candidate Trump about the call soon afterwards.92° Cohen told Trump he spoke 
with a woman he identified as " someone from the Kremlin," and Cohen reported that she was very 
professional and asked detailed questions about the  project.921  Cohen recalled telling Trump he 
wished the Trump Organization  had assistants who  were  as competent as the woman  from  the 
Kremlin.922 

Cohen thought his phone call renewed interest in the project.923  The day after Cohen 's call 
with Poliakova, Sater texted Cohen, asking him to "[c]all me when you have a few minutes to chat 
... It's about Putin they called today."924  Sater told Cohen that the Russian government liked the 
project and on  January 25, 2016,  sent an  invitation  for  Cohen to  visit Moscow " for  a  working 
visit."925  After the outreach from Sater, Cohen recalled telling Trump that he was waiting to hear 
back on moving the project forward.926 

After January 2016, Cohen continued to have conversations with Sater about Trump Tower 
Moscow and continued to keep candidate Trump updated about those discussions and the status 
of the project.927  Cohen recalled that he and Trump wanted Trump Tower Moscow to succeed and 
that Trump never discouraged  him  from  working on the project because of the  campaign.928  In 
March or April  2016,  Trump asked Cohen  if anything was happening in  Russia.929  Cohen also

recalled briefing Donald  Trump  Jr.  in  the spring-a conversation that Cohen said was not " idle 
chit chat" because Trump Tower Moscow was potentially a $1  billion deal.930 

Cohen recalled that around May 2016, he again raised with candidate Trump the possibility 
of a  trip  to Russia to advance  the  Trump Tower Moscow project.931  At  that time,  Cohen  had 
received several texts from Sater seeking to arrange dates for such a trip. 932  On May 4, 2016, Sater 
wrote  to Cohen, "T  had a  chat with  Moscow.  ASSUMING the trip does happen the question  is 
before or after the convention ..... Obviously the premeeting trip (you only) can happen anytime 
you  want  but the 2  big  guys  [is]  the  question.  I  said  I  would  confirm  and  revert."933  Cohen 
responded,  "My  trip  before  Cleveland.  Trump  once  he  becomes  the  nominee  after  the 
convention."934  On May 5, 2016, Sater followed up with a text that Cohen thought he probably 
read to Trump: 

Peskov would like to  invite you as his guest to the St.  Petersburg Forum which  is 
Russia' s  Davos  it's June  16-19.  He wants  to  meet  there with  you  and  possibly 
introduce you to either Putin or Medvedev .... This is perfect.  The entire business 
class of Russia will be there as well.  He said anything you want to discuss including 
dates and subjects are on the table to discuss.935 

Cohen  recalled  discussing  the  invitation  to  the  St.  Petersburg  Economic  Forum  with 
candidate  Trump  and  saying that Putin or Russian  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  might be 
there.936  Cohen remembered that Trump said that he would be willing to travel to Russia if Cohen 
could " lock and load" on the deal.937  Tn  June 2016, Cohen decided not to attend the St. Petersburg 
Economic Forum  because Sater had not obtained a  formal  invitation for Cohen  from  Peskov.938 
Cohen said he had a quick conversation with Trump at that time but did not tell him that the project 
was  over because he did  not want Trump to complain that the  deal was on-again-off-again  if it 
were revived.939 

During the summer of 2016, Cohen recalled that candidate Trump publicly claimed that he 
had nothing to do with Russia and then shortly afterwards privately checked with Cohen about the 
status of the Trump Tower Moscow project, which Cohen found "interesting."940  At some point

that  summer,  Cohen  recalled  having a  brief conversation  with  Trump  in  which  Cohen said the 
Trump Tower Moscow project was going nowhere  because the  Russian development company 
had not secured a piece of property for the project.941  Trump said that was " too bad," and Cohen 
did not recall talking with Trump about the project after that.942  Cohen said that at no time during 
the  campaign  did  Trump  tell  him  not  to  pursue  the  project  or  that  the  project  should  be 
abandoned. 943 

2.  Cohen Determines to  Adhere  to a  "Party Line" Distancing Candidate Trump 

From Russia 

As previously discussed, see Volume II, Section II.A, supra, when questions about possible 
Russian  support  for  candidate  Trump  emerged  during  the  2016  presidential  campaign,  Trump 
denied having any personal, financial,  or business connection to Russia, which Cohen described 
as the "party line"  or "message" to follow for Trump and his senior advisors.944 

After the  election,  the Trump Organization sought to formally  close out certain deals in 
advance of the inauguration.945  Cohen recalled that Trump Tower Moscow was on the list of deals 
to  be closed out.946  In  approximately January 2017,  Cohen  began  receiving inquiries from  the 
media about Trump Tower Moscow, and he  recalled speaking to the President-Elect when those 
inquiries came in.947  Cohen was concerned that truthful answers about the Trump Tower Moscow 
project might not be consistent with  the "message" that the President-Elect had  no  relationship 
with Russia.948 

In an effort to "stay on  message,"  Cohen told a New York Times reporter that the Trump 
Tower Moscow deal was not feasible  and had ended in  January 2016.949  Cohen recalled that this 
was part of a " script" or talking points he had developed with President-Elect Trump and others to 

941 Cohen 3/19/19 302, at 2.  Cohen could not recall the precise timing of this conversation, but said 
he thought it occurred in June or July 2016.  Cohen recalled that the conversation happened at some point 
after candidate Trump was publicly stating that he  had nothing to  do  with Russia.  Cohen 3/19/19 302, at

Sater and Cohen had been working on plan for a Trump Tower Moscow "as  recently as the fall  of2015" 
but had come to a halt because of the presidential campaign.  Consistent with Cohen's intended patty line 
message, the article stated, "Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project 
in  Moscow  from  a  Russian  real  estate  developer  at that  time  but  determined  that  the  project  was  not 
feasible."  Megan Twohey & Scott Shane, A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump

dismiss  the  idea  of a  substantial  connection  between Trump  and  Russia.95° Cohen said that he 
discussed the talking points with Trump but that he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they 
were untrue because Trump already knew they were untrue.951  Cohen thought it was important to 
say the deal was done  in  January 2016, rather than acknowledge that talks continued in May and 
June  2016,  because  it  limited  the  period  when  candidate  Trump  could  be  alleged  to  have  a 
relationship with Russia to an early point in the campaign, before Trump had become the party's 
presumptive nominee.952 

3.  Cohen  Submits False  Statements to Congress Minimizing the  Trump  Tower 

Moscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line 

In  early  May  2017,  Cohen  received  requests  from  Congress  to  provide  testimony  and 
documents  in  connection  with  congressional  investigations of Russian  interference  in  the  2016 
election.953  At that time,  Cohen  understood  Congress's  interest  in  him  to  be  focused  on  the 
allegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials 
in  Prague during the campaign.954  Cohen had  never traveled  to  Prague and was  not concerned 
about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.955  On May 18, 2017, Cohen met 
with the  President to discuss the request from  Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that 
he should cooperate because there was nothing there.956 

Cohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JOA) with the President and other 
individuals  who  were  part  of the  Russia  investigation.957 
In  the  months  leading  up  to  his 
congressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President's personal counsel.958  Cohen

958  Cohen  11 / 12/18  302,  at  2-3;  Cohen  11/20/18,  at  2-6.  Cohen  told  investigators  about  his 
conversations with the President's personal  counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this 
Office advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege, 
including communications protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege.  As a result, most of 
what Cohen told us about his conversations with the President's personal counsel concerned what Cohen 
had communicated to the President's personal counsel, and not what was said in response.  Cohen described 
certain statements  made  by the President's personal  counsel,  however,  that  are set forth  in  this  section. 
Cohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected 
those statements because they had knowledge of the scope of their joint defense agreement and  access to 
privileged communications that may have provided context for evaluating the statements they shared.  After 
interviewing Cohen about these matters, we asked the President's personal counsel if he wished to provide 
information to  us about his  conversations with  Cohen related to Cohen's congressional  testimony  about 

139 

Atterrte,-· \llerk Preettet // Ma,-· Certtairt Material Preteetee Urteer Fee. R.  Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

said that in  those conversations the President' s personal counsel would sometimes say that he had 
just been with the President.959  Cohen recalled that the President' s personal counsel told him the 
JOA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and if they stayed on 
message the investigations would come to an end soon.960  At that time, Cohen's legal bills were 
being  paid  by  the  Trump  Organization,961  and  Cohen  was  told  not  to  worry  because  the 
investigations  would  be  over  by  summer  or  fall  of 20 l 7.962  Cohen  said  that  the  President's 
personal counsel also conveyed that, as part of the JOA, Cohen was protected, which he would not 
be if he "went rogue."963  Cohen recalled that the President's personal counsel reminded him that 
"the President loves you" and told him that ifhe stayed on message, the President had his back.964 

In August 2017, Cohen began drafting a statement about Trump Tower Moscow to submit 
to Congress along with his document production.965  The final version of the statement contained 
several false statements about the project.966  First, although the Trump Organization continued to 
pursue  the  project  until  at  least  June  2016,  the  statement  said,  "The  proposal  was  under 
consideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016.  By 
the end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business 
reasons  and  should  not  be  pursued  further.  Based on  my  business  determinations,  the Trump 
Organization  abandoned  the  proposal."967  Second,  although  Cohen  and  candidate Trump  had 
discussed possible travel to Russia by Trump to pursue the venture, the statement said, "Despite 
overtures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trump to travel to Russia in connection with 
this  proposal.  I  told Mr.  Sater that  Mr.  Trump would  not travel  to  Russia  unless  there  was  a 
definitive agreement in place."968 Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump on the status 

Trump Tower Moscow.  The President's personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated 
that he could not disaggregate information he  had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained 
from other parties in the IDA.  In  view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen's counsel to withhold 
communications that could  be covered by privilege, the President's personal counsel 's uncertainty about 
the provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support 
a claim of privilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements 
Cohen provided in  this report.  If the statements were to be used  in  a context beyond this report, further 
analysis could be warranted.

of the project and had numerous conversations about it, the statement said, "Mr. Trump was never 
in contact with anyone about this proposal other than me on three occasions, including signing a 
non-binding letter of intent in 2015."969  Fourth, although Cohen's outreach to Peskov in January 
2016 had  resulted in  a  lengthy phone call with a  representative from  the Kremlin, the statement 
said that Cohen did "not recall any response to  my email  [to Peskov ],  nor any other contacts by 
me with Mr. Peskov or other Russian government officials about the proposal."970 

Cohen's  statement was circulated  in  advance to, and edited by,  members of the  JDA.97 1 
Before the statement was finalized, early drafts contained a sentence stating, "The building project 
led me to make limited contacts with Russian government officials."972  In the final version of the 
statement, that line was deleted.973  Cohen thought he was told that it was a decision of the JOA to 
take out that sentence, and he did not push back on the deletion.974  Cohen recalled that he told the 
President's personal counsel that he would not contest a decision of the JDA.975 

Cohen  also  recalled  that  in  drafting  his  statement  for  Congress,  he  spoke  with  the 
President's  personal  counsel  about a  different  issue that connected candidate Trump  to  Russia: 
Cohen's efforts to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin in New York during the 2015 United 
Nations General  Assembly.976  In September 2015,  Cohen had suggested the meeting to Trump, 
who told Cohen to reach out to Putin ' s office about it.977  Cohen spoke and emailed with a Russian 
official about a possible meeting, and recalled that Trump asked him multiple times for updates on 
the proposed meeting with Putin.978  When Cohen called the Russian  official a  second time,  she 
told him it would not follow proper protocol for Putin to meet with Trump, and Cohen relayed that

message to Trump.979  Cohen anticipated he might be asked questions about the proposed Trump(cid:173)
Putin meeting when he testified before Congress because he had talked about the potential meeting 
on  Sean Hannity's radio  show.98° Cohen recalled explaining to the President's personal counsel 
the "whole story" of the attempt to set up a  meeting between Trump and Putin and Trump's role 
in  it.981  Cohen recalled that he and the President's personal counsel talked about keeping Trump 
out of the narrative, and the President's personal counsel told Cohen the story was not relevant and 
should not be included in  his statement to Congress.982 

Cohen  said  that  his  "agenda"  in  submitting  the  statement  to  Congress  with  false 
representations about the Trump Tower Moscow project was to minimize links between the project 
and the President, give the false impression that the project had ended before the first presidential 
primaries, and shut down further inquiry into Trump Tower Moscow, with the aim of limiting the 
ongoing Russia investigations.983  Cohen said he wanted to protect the President and be loyal to 
him by not contradicting anything the President had said.984  Cohen recalled he was concerned that 
ifhe told the truth about getting a response from the Kremlin or speaking to candidate Trump about 
travel to Russia to pursue the project, he would contradict the message that no connection existed 
between Trump  and Russia, and  he  rationalized  his decision  to  provide false testimony because 
the  deal  never  happened.985  He  was  not  concerned  that  the  story  would  be  contradicted  by 
individuals who knew it was false because he was sticking to the party line adhered to by the whole 
group.986  Cohen wanted the support of the President and the White House, and he believed that 
following  the  party  line  would  help  put  an  end  to  the  Special  Counsel  and  congressional 
investigations.987 

Between August 18, 2017, when the statement was in an initial draft stage, and August 28, 
2017, when the statement was submitted to Congress, phone records reflect that Cohen spoke with 
the  President's  pcersonal  counsel  almost daily.988  On  August 27,  2017,  the  day  before  Cohen

submitted the statement to Congress, Cohen and the President's personal  counsel  had  numerous 
contacts by phone, including calls lasting three, four, six, eleven, and eighteen minutes.989  Cohen 
recalled  telling the President's personal counsel,  who  did  not have first-hand  knowledge  of the 
project,  that  there  was  more  detail  on  Trump  Tower  Moscow  that  was  not  in  the  statement, 
including  that  there  were  more  communications  with  Russia  and  more  communications  with 
candidate  Trump  than  the  statement  reflected.99°  Cohen  stated  that  the  President's  personal 
counsel responded that it was not necessary to elaborate or include those details because the project 
did not progress and that Cohen should keep his statement short and "tight" and the matter would 
soon  come to an  end.991  Cohen  recalled  that  the  President's personal  counsel  said " his  client" 
appreciated Cohen, that Cohen should stay on message and not contradict the President, that there 
was no need to muddy the water, and that it was time to move on.992  Cohen said he agreed because 
it was what he was expected to do.993  After Cohen later pleaded guilty to making false statements 
to  Congress  about  the  Trump  Tower  Moscow  project,  this  Office  sought  to  speak  with  the 
President's personal counsel about these conversations with Cohen,  but counsel  declined, citing 
potential privilege concerns.994 

At the same time  that Cohen finalized his written submission to Congress, he served as a 
source for a  Washington  Post story published on August 27, 2017, that reported  in depth for the 
first time that the Trump Organization was "pursuing a plan to develop a  massive  Trump Tower 
in Moscow" at the same time as candidate Trump was "running for president.in late 2015 and early 
2016."995  The article reported that "the project was abandoned at the  end  of January  2016, just 
before the presidential primaries began, several people familiar with the proposal said."996  Cohen 
recalled that in speaking to the Post, he held to the false story that negotiations for the deal ceased 
in January 2016.997

On  August  28,  2017,  Cohen  submitted  his  statement about the  Trump Tower Moscow 
project to Congress.998  Cohen did  not recall talking to the President about the specifics of what 
the  statement  said  or what  Cohen  would  later  testify  to  about  Trump  Tower  Moscow.999  He 
recalled speaking to the President more generally about how he planned to stay on message in his 
testimony.1000  On  September  19,  2017,  in  anticipation  of his  impending  testimony,  Cohen 
orchestrated the public release of his opening remarks to Congress, which criticized the allegations 
in  the  Steele  material  and  claimed  that the  Trump  Tower  Moscow project "was terminated  in 
January  of 2016;  which  occurred  before  the  Iowa  caucus  and  months  before  the  very  first 
primary." 1001  Cohen said the release of his opening remarks was intended to shape the narrative 
and let other people who might be witnesses know what Cohen was saying so they could follow 
the same message.1002  Cohen said his decision was meant to mirror Jared Kushner's decision to 
release  a  statement  in  advance  of Kushner's  congressional  testimony,  which  the  President's 
personal counsel  had told Cohen the President  liked. 1003  Cohen recalled that on  September 20, 
2017,  after  Cohen's  opening  remarks  had  been  printed  by  the  media,  the President's  personal 
counsel told him that the President was pleased with the Trump Tower Moscow statement that had 
gone out.1004 

On  October  24  and  25,  2017,  Cohen  testified  before  Congress  and  repeated  the  false 
statements  he  had  included  in  his  written  statement  about Trump  Tower  Moscow. 1005  Phone 
records  show  that  Cohen  spoke  with  the  President's  personal  counsel  immediately  after  his 
testimony on both days. 1006

with the President before he ran for office.1007  This Office did not investigate Cohen's campaign(cid:173)
period payments to women. 1008  However, those events, as described here, are potentially relevant 
to the President's and his personal counsel's interactions with Cohen as a witness who later began 
to cooperate with the government. 

On February 13, 2018, Cohen released a statement to news organizations that stated, "In a 
private transaction  in  20 I 6,  I used my own personal funds to facilitate  a payment of $130,000 to 
[the  woman].  Neither  the  Trump  Organization  nor  the  Trump  campaign  was  a  party  to  the 
transaction  with  [the  woman],  and  neither  reimbursed  me  for  the  payment,  either  directly  or 
indirectly."1009  In  congressional  testimony  on  February  27,  2019,  Cohen  testified  that  he  had 
discussed what to say  about the  payment with the President and that the  President had  directed 
Cohen to say that the President "was not knowledgeable .. . of [Cohen's] actions" in making the 
payment. 1010  On  February  19,  2018, the day after  the  New York Times wrote a  detailed story 
attributing the payment to Cohen and describing Cohen as the President's "fixer," Cohen received 
a text message from the President's personal counsel that stated, "Client says thanks for what you 
do." 1011 

On April  9,  2018,  FBI  agents working with the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York executed search warrants on Cohen's home, hotel room, and office.1012  That 
day, the President spoke to reporters and said that he had "just heard that they broke into the office 
of one  of my  personal  attorneys-a good  man."1013  The President  called  the  searches  "a real 
disgrace" and said, "It's an attack on our country, in  a true sense.  It's an attack on what we all

1008  The  Office  was  authorized  to  investigate  Cohen 's  establishment  and  use  of  Essential 
Consultants LLC, which Cohen created to facilitate the $130,000 payment during the campaign, based on 
evidence that the entity received funds from Russian-backed entities.  Cohen's use of Essential Consultants 
to facilitate  the $130,000 payment to  the woman during the campaign was part of the Office's referral of 
certain Cohen-related matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

that he did not want issues arising from the payments to women to "come out,"  and that his false 
statements to Congress were "a big concern." 1015

. 

A  few days  after the  searches,  the  President called Cohen.1016  According  to Cohen,  the 
President said he wanted to "che~k in" and asked if Cohen was okay, and the President encouraged 
Cohen to "hang in there" and "stay strong." 1017  Cohen also recalled that following the searches he 
heard from  individuals who were in touch with the President and relayed to Cohen the President's 
support for him. 1018  Cohen recalled that 
, a friend of the President's, reached out 
to say that he was with "the Boss" in M  r  La  o  nd t  e President had said "he loves you" and 
not to worry. 1019  Cohen recalled that 
for the Trump 
Organization, told him, "the boss loves you." 
, a friend 
of the President's, told him, "everyone knows the boss has your back." 

On or about April l 7, 20 l 8, Cohen began speaking with an attorney, Robert Costello, who 
had  a  close  relationship  with  Rudolph  Giuliani,  one  of the  President's  personal  lawyers. 1022 
Costello told Cohen that he had a "back channel of communication" to Giuliani, and that Giuliani 
had said the "channel" was "crucial" and "must be maintained." 1023  On April 20, 2018, the New 
York Times published an article about the President's relationship with and treatment of Cohen. 1024 
The President responded with a series of tweets predicting that Cohen would not "flip" : 

The New York Times and a  third  rate  reporter . . . are  going out of their way to destroy 
Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will  ' flip. '  They use non(cid:173)

horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media! 1025 

In an email that day to Cohen, Costello wrote that he had spoken with Giuliani. 1026  Costello told 
Cohen the conversation was "Very Very Positive[.]  You are ' loved' ... they are in our corner ... . 
Sleep well tonight[], you have friends in high places."1027 

Cohen  said that  following these  messages  he  believed  he  had  the  support of the  White 
House if he continued to toe the party line,  and he determined to stay on message and be part of 
the team. 1028  At the time, Cohen's understood that his legal fees were still being paid by the Trump 
Organization, which he said was important to him. 1029  Cohen believed he needed the power of the 
President to take care of him, so he needed to defend the President and stay on message. 1030 

Cohen also recalled speaking with the President's personal counsel about pardons after the 
searches of his home and office had occurred, at a time when the media had reported that pardon 
discussions were occurring at the White House. 1031  Cohen told the  President' s  personal counsel 
he  had  been  a  loyal  lawyer  and  servant,  and  he  said  that  after  the  searches  he  was  in  an 
uncomfortable position and wanted to know what was in  it for him. 1032  According to Cohen, the 
President's personal counsel responded that Cohen should stay on message, that the investigation 
was  a  witch  hunt,  and  that  everything  would  be  fine. 1033  Cohen  understood  based  on  this 
conversation and previous conversations about pardons with the President' s personal counsel that 
as  long as he stayed on  message,  he  would be taken care of by  the  President,  either through  a 
pardon or through the investigation being shut down. 1034

On  April  24,  2018,  the  President  responded  to  a  reporter's  inquiry  whether  he  would 
consider a  pardon for Cohen with, "Stupid question." 1035  On June 8, 2018, the President said he 
"hadn't even thought about"  pardons for Manafort or Cohen, and continued, "It's far too early to 
be thinking about that.  They haven't been convicted of anything.  There's nothing to pardon." 1036 
And  on  June  15,  2018,  the President expressed sympathy for  Cohen, Manafort,  and  Flynn  in  a 
press  interview and  said,  " I  feel  badly  about  a  lot  of them,  because  I  think  a  lot of it  is  very 
unfair." 1037 

5.  The President's Conduct After Cohen Began Cooperating with the Government 

On July 2, 2018, ABC News reported based on an "exclusive"  interview with Cohen that 
Cohen "strongly signaled  his  willingness  to  cooperate with  special counsel Robert Mueller and 
federal  prosecutors in the Southern District of New York--even  if that puts President Trump  in 
jeopardy."1038  That week, the media repotted that Cohen had added an attorney to his legal team 
who previously had worked as a legal advisor to President Bill Clinton.1039 

Beginning on July 20, 2018, the media reported on the existence of a recording Cohen had 
made of a conversation he had with candidate Trump about a  payment made to a  second woman 
who  said  she  had  had  an  affair  with  Trump.1040  On  July  21,  2018,  the  President  responded : 
"Inconceivable that the government would break into  a  lawyer' s office (early in  the morning)(cid:173)
almost unheard of.  Even more inconceivable that a  lawyer would tape a client-totally unheard 
of &  perhaps illegal.  The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!"1041  On 
July 27, 2018, after the media reported that Cohen was willing to inform investigators that Donald 
Trump Jr. told his father about the June 9, 2016 meeting to get "dirt" on Hillary Clinton, 1042  the 
President tweeted:  "[S]o the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO, I  did 
NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr.  Sounds to me like someone is try ing to make up

and Crooked Hillary's lawyer.  Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!"1043 

On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to eight 
felony  charges,  including  two  counts  of campaign-finance violations  based on the  payments he 
had made  during the final  weeks of the campaign to  women who  said  they  had  affairs with the 
President. 1044  During the plea hearing, Cohen stated that he  had worked "at the direction of' the 
candidate  in  making  those  payments. 1045  The  next  day,  the  President  contrasted  Cohen' s 
cooperation with Manafort's refusal to cooperate, tweeting, "I feel  very badly for Paul Manafort

and  his  wonderful  family. 
tremendous pressure on him and,  unlike Michael Cohen,  he  refused to 'break'-make up stories 
in order to get a 'deal.'  Such respect for a brave man!"1046 

On  September  17,  2018,  this  Office  submitted  written  questions  to  the  President  that 
included  questions  about  the  Trump  Tower  Moscow  project  and  attached  Cohen's  written 
statement to Congress and the  Letter of Intent signed  by the President. 1047  Among other issues, 
the questions asked the President to describe the timing and substance of discussions he had with 
Cohen  about  the  project,  whether  they  discussed  a  potential  trip  to  Russia,  and  whether  the 
President "at any time direct[ ed] or suggest[ ed] that discussions about the Trump Moscow project 
should  cease,"  or whether  the  President  was  "informed  at  any  time  that the  project  had  been 
abandoned."1048 

On November 20, 2018, the President submitted written responses that did not answer those 
questions  about Trump Tower Moscow directly and did  not provide any  information  about the 
timing of the candidate's discussions with Cohen about the project or whether he participated in 
any  discussions  about  the  project  being  abandoned  or  no  longer  pursued. 1049 
Instead,  the 
President's answers stated in relevant part: 

I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject.  As I recall; they were brief,  and 
they were not memorable.  I was not enthused about the proposal, and I do not recall any 
discussion of travel to Russia in  connection with it.  I do not remember discussing it with

anyone else at the Trump Organization, although it is possible.  T do not recall being aware 
at the time of any communications between Mr. Cohen and Felix Sater and any Russian 
government official regarding the Letter oflntent. 1050 

On November  29,  2018,  Cohen  pleaded  guilty  to  making  false  statements  to  Congress 
based on his statements about the Trump Tower Moscow project. 1051  In a plea agreement with this 
Office,  Cohen agreed to "provide truthful  information regarding any and all  matters as to which 
this  Office  deems  relevant."1052  Later on November 29, after Cohen's  guilty plea had become 
public, the President spoke to reporters about the Trump Tower Moscow project, saying: 

I decided not to do the project.  .  . .  I  decided ultimately not to do  it.  There would have 
been nothing wrong ifI did do it.  Ifl did do it, there would have been nothing wrong.  That 
was my business ....  It was an option that I decided not to do ....  I decided not to do it. 
The primary reason  .  . .  T was focused  on  running for President.  .  .  .  I was running my 
business while I was campaigning.  There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in 
which  case  I  would've  gone  back  into  the  business.  And  why  should  I  lose  lots  of 
opportunities? 1053 

The President also said that Cohen was "a weak person.  And by being weak, unlike other people 
that you watch-he is  a weak person.  And what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence.  So 
he's lying about a project that everybody knew about." 1054  The President also brought up Cohen's 
written submission to Congress regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project: "So here's the story: 
Go back and look at the paper that Michael  Cohen wrote before he testified  in the House and/or 
Senate.  It talked  about his  position."1055  The  President added,  "Even  if [Cohen]  was  right,  it 
doesn't matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign."1056 

In light of the President's public statements following Cohen's guilty plea that he "decided 
not to do the  project," this Office again  sought information from  the President about whether he 
participated in any discussions about the project being abandoned or no longer pursued, including 
when he "decided not to do the project," who he spoke to about that decision , and what motivated

the  decision. 1057  The Office also again asked for the timing of the President's discussions with 
Cohen about Trump Tower Moscow and asked him to specify "what period of the campaign" he 
was  involved  in  discussions  concerning  the  project. 1058 
In  response,  the  President's  personal 
counsel declined to provide additional information from the President and stated that "the President 
has fully answered the questions at issue." 1059 

In the weeks following Cohen' s  plea and agreement to  provide assistance to  this Office, 
the  President  repeatedly  implied  that  Cohen's  family  members  were  guilty  of crimes.  On 
December 3,  2018,  after Cohen  had  filed  his  sentencing  memorandum,  the  President tweeted, 
'"Michael  Cohen  asks judge for  no Prison Time.'  You mean  he can  do all  of the TERRIBLE, 
unrelated to Trump,  things  having to do with fraud,  big loans,  Taxis,  etc., and  not serve a  long 
prison term?  He makes up stories to get a GREAT &  ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and 
get his wife and father-in-law  (who  has the money?)  off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and 
should, in m  o  inion  serve a full and com  lete sentence."1060 

On Decem her 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. 1062  The next 

day, the President sent a series of tweets that said: 

I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law .... Those charges were just agreed to by 
him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he 
did-including the  fact  that his family  was  temporarily  let off the  hook.  As  a  lawyer, 
Michael has great liability to me! 1063 

On December 16, 2018, the President tweeted, "Remember, Michael Cohen only became a  'Rat' 
after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt 
was illegally started.  They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!  Why didn't they break 
into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked' s office?"1064 

In January 2019, after the media reported that Cohen would provide public testimony in a 
congressional hearing, the President made additional  public comments  suggesting that Cohen's

family members had committed crimes.  In an interview on Fox on January 12, 2019, the President 
was asked whether he was worried about Cohen's testimony and responded: 

[I]n order to get his sentence reduced, [Cohen] says "I have an idea, I'll ah, tell-I'll give 
you some information on the president."  Well, there is no information.  But he should give 
information maybe on his father-in-law because that's the one that people want to look at 
because  where  does  that money-that's the money in the family.  And I guess he didn't 
want to  talk about his father-in-law,  he's trying to get his sentence reduced.  So it's ah, 
pretty sad.  You know, it' s weak and it's very sad to watch a thing like that. 1065 

On  January  18,  2019,  the  President tweeted,  "Kevin  Corke,  @FoxNews  ' Don 't  forget, 
Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the 
Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars .... '  Lying 
to reduce his jail time!  Watchfather-in-law/" 1066 

On January 23, 2019, Cohen postponed his congressional testimony, citing threats against 
his family. 1067  The next day, the President tweeted, "So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen, 
who sadly will not be testifying before Congress,  is  using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton 
to represent him-Gee, how did that happen?" 1068 

Also  in  January 2019, Giuliani  gave  press  interviews  that appeared  to  confirm  Cohen's 
account that the Trump Organization pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project well past January 
2016.  Giuliani  stated  that " it's  our understanding  that  [discussions about the  Trump  Moscow 
project] went on throughout 2016.  Weren't a lot of them, but there were conversations.  Can't be 
sure of the exact date.  But the president can remember having conversations with him  about it. 
The  president  also  remembers-yeah,  probably  up-could  be  up  to  as  far  as  October, 
November." 1069  In an interview with the New York Times, Giuliani quoted the President as saying 
that  the  discussions  regarding  the  Trump  Moscow  project  were  "going  on  from  the  day  I 
announced to the day I won." 1070  On January 21, 2019, Giuliani issued a statement that said: "My 
recent  statements  about  discussions  during  the  2016  campaign  between  Michael  Cohen  and 
candidate Donald Trump about a  potential Trump  Moscow  ' project'  were  hypothetical  and not 
based on conversations I had with the president." 1071

U.S. Department of Justice 

Analysis 

In analyzing the  President's conduct related to  Cohen, the following evidence is relevant 

to the elements of obstruction of justice. 

a. 

Obstructive act.  We gathered evidence of the President' s conduct related to Cohen 
on two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen's false statements 
to Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the  natural tendency to 
prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government. 

i. 

First,  with  regard  to Cohen's false  statements to Congress, while there  is 
evidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress 
about the Trump Tower Moscow project,  the evidence available to us does not establish that the 
President directed or aided Cohen' s false testimony. 

Cohen said that his statements to Congress followed a "party line" that developed within 
the campaign to align with the President's public statements distancing the President from Russia. 
Cohen also recalled that, in  speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear 
that he would stay on message-which Cohen believed they both  understood would require false 
testimony.  But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen's 
testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false,  and the President did 
not direct him to  provide false testimony.  Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the 
specifics of his  planned testimony.  During the  time when  his  statement to  Congress was being 
drafted and circulated to members of the JOA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about 
the statement, but rather communicated with the President's personal counsel-as corroborated by 
phone  records  showing extensive communications between  Cohen and  the  President's  personal 
counsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress. 

Cohen recalled that in his discussions with the President's personal counsel on August 27, 
2017-
the day before Cohen's statement was submitted to Congress- Cohen said that there were 
more  communications with  Russia  and  more  communications  with  candidate  Trump  than  the 
statement reflected.  Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time.  According to Cohen, 
the  President's  personal  counsel-who  did  not  have  first-hand  knowledge  of the  project(cid:173)
responded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include 
those details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short 
and tight,  not elaborate, stay on message, and  not contradict the President.  Cohen's recollection 
of the content of those conversations is consistent with direction  about the substance of Cohen' s 
draft statement that appeared to come from  members of the JOA.  For example,  Cohen omitted 
any reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump 
and Putin during the United Nations General  Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a  decision of 

of conversations  beyond  that  contained  in  the  President's  [ written  responses  to  the  Special  Counsel 's 
Office]."  2/6/19 Letter, President's Personal Counsel to Special Counsel's Office.

the IDA to delete the sentence, "The building project led me to make limited contacts with Russian 
government officials." 

The  President's  personal  counsel  declined  to  provide  us  with  his  account  of  his 
conversations with Cohen, and there is  no evidence available to us that indicates that the President 
was aware of the information Cohen provided to the President's personal counsel.  The President's 
conversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege, 
and we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications.  The absence of evidence 
about  the  President  and  his  counsel's  conversations  about  the  drafting  of Cohen ' s  statement 
precludes us from assessing what,  if any, role the President played. 

ii. 

the  natural  tendency  to  prevent  Cohen  from  providing  truthful 
investigators or to Congress. 

Second, we considered whether the President took actions that would have 
information  to  criminal 

Before Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately 
urged Cohen to stay on message and not " flip."  Cohen recalled the President's personal counsel 
telling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go " rogue."  In the days and weeks 
that fol lowed the Apri 1 2018 searches of Cohen' s home and office, the President told reporters that 
Cohen was a "good man" and said he was "a fine person with a wonderful family ... who I  have 
always  liked  &  respected."  Privately,  the  President told  Cohen  to  "hang  in  there"  and  "stay 
strong."  People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that 
"the President loves you," "the boss loves you," and "everyone knows the boss has your back." 
Through the President' s  personal  counsel, the President also had  previously told  Cohen "thanks 
for what you do" after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that, 
according  to  Cohen,  both  Cohen  and  the President  knew was  false.  At that  time,  the  Trump 
Organization continued to pay  Cohen's  legal  fees,  which was important to Cohen.  Cohen  also 
recalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President's personal counsel, who told him 
to stay on message and everything would be fine.  The President indicated in his public statements 
that a  pardon had not been ruled out,  and also stated publicly that " [m]ost people will  flip  if the 
Government lets them out of trouble" but that he "d[idn't] see Michael doing that." 

After it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the 
President accused Cohen of "mak[ing] up stories in  order to get himself out of an  unrelated jam 
(Taxi  cabs  maybe?),"  called  Cohen  a  "rat," and  on  multiple occasions  publicly  suggested  that 
Cohen's family members had committed crimes.  The evidence concerning this sequence of events 
could suppot1 an inference that the President used  inducements in  the form  of positive messages 
in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the 
provision of information or undermine Cohen's credibility once Cohen began cooperating. 

b. 

Nexus to an official proceeding.  The President's relevant"conduct towards Cohen 
occurred when the President knew the Special Counsel's Office, Congress, and the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of New York were investigating Cohen's conduct.  The President 
acknowledged through  his  public statements and tweets that Cohen  potentially could  cooperate 
with the government investigations.

c. 

Intent. 

In  analyzing  the  President's  intent  in  his  actions  towards  Cohen  as  a 
potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to 
discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed 
adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements. 

i. 

Cohen's  false  congressional  testimony  about  the  Trump  Tower  Moscow 
project was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit 
the congressional and DOJ Russia investigations-a goal that was in  the President's  interest,  as 
reflected by the President's own statements.  During and after the campaign, the President made 
repeated statements that he had  "no business" in  Russia and said that there  were "no deals that 
could  happen  in  Russia,  because  we've  stayed  away."  As  Cohen  knew,  and  as  he  recalled 
communicating  to  the  President  during  the  campaign,  Cohen' s  pursuit  of the  Trump  Tower 
Moscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements. 

In connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with 
candidate  Trump to  give  him  status  updates  about the  Trump  Tower Moscow  project,  that the 
conversations continued through at least June 2016, and  that he  discussed  with  Trump possible 
travel to Russia to pursue the project.  The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, 
because the project had  the potential  to  be  so  lucrative.  In  addition, text messages to and from 
Cohen and  other records further establish that Cohen's efforts to advance the project did not end 
in  January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible 
trips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project. 

The evidence could support an  inference that the President was aware of these facts at the 
time of Cohen's false  statements to Congress.  Cohen discussed the project with the President in 
early 2017 following  media inquiries.  Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after 
he released to the public his opening remarks to Congress- which said the project "was terminated 
in  January of 2016"-the President's personal counsel  told  him  the President was pleased with 
what Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow.  And after Cohen' s guilty plea, the President 
told reporters tha.t  he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the  inference 
that he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign 
in which the project was being pursued. 

ii. 

The President's public remarks following Cohen's guilty plea also suggest 
that the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump 
Tower Moscow project.  At the time  the President submitted written answers to questions  from 
this Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating 
with the government but Cohen had not yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress. 
Accordingly, it was  not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided 
to the government.  In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing 
and substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no  indication that he had 
decided to  no  longer pursue  the  project.  Yet after Cohen  pleaded guilty, the  President publicly 
stated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the project.  The President then declined 
to clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions.  The content and 
timing of the President's provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the 
Trump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the 
information that Cohen could provide as a witness.

111. 

The President's concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed 
at the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the  President's dealings 
with Cohen rather than an  investigation of Trump Tower Moscow.  There also  is  some evidence 
that the President's concern  about Cohen cooperating was based on the President's stated belief 
that Cohen would  provide false testimony against the President in  an  attempt to obtain  a  lesser 
sentence for his unrelated criminal conduct.  The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, 
refused to "break" and "make up stories in order to get a  'deal."'  And after Cohen pleaded guilty 
to  making false statements to Congress,  the President said, "what [Cohen]'s trying to do is  get a 
reduced sentence.  So he's lying about a  project that everybody knew about."  But the President 
also  appeared  to  defend the underlying conduct,  saying, "Even  if [Cohen]  was  right,  it doesn't 
matter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign."  As described above, 
there is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump 
Tower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President' s 
connections to Russia during the campaign. 

iv. 

Finally,  the  President's  statements  insinuating  that members  of Cohen's 
family committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as 
an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill  further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen 
or others.  It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen "ma[d]e[] 
up stories" in order to get a deal for himself and "get his wife and father-in-law .. . off Scott Free." 
It also is possible that the President's mention of Cohen's wife and father-in-law were not intended 
to affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting 
Cohen  and  deflecting  attention  away  from  the  President  on  Cohen-related  matters.  But  the 
President's suggestion that Cohen's family members committed crimes happened more than once, 
including just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen 
"should,  in  my opinion,  serve  a  full  and complete  sentence") and  again just before  Cohen  was 
scheduled to testify before Congress.  The timing of the statements supports an inference that they 
were intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from  further cooperation. 

L. 

Overarching Factual Issues 

Although  this  report  does  not  contain  a  traditional  prosecution  decision  or  declination 
decision,  the  evidence  supports  several  general  conclusions  relevant  to  analysis  of the  facts 
concerning the President's course of conduct. 

1.  Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-of(cid:173)

justice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice. 

First, the conduct involved actions by the President.  Some of the conduct did not implicate 
the  President's  constitutional  authority  and  raises  garden-variety  obstruction-of-justice  issues. 
Other events  we  investigated,  however,  drew  upon  the President's  Article  II  authority,  which 
raised constitutional issues that we address in Volume II, Section III.B, infra.  A factual analysis 
of that conduct would have to take into account both that the President's acts were facially lawful 
and  that his  position  as  head of the  Executive Branch  provides  him  with  unique  and  powerful 
means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses. 

156 

Atter11ey Werk Preettet // May Cetttaitt Material Preteetee U11eer Fee. R . Cril'H.  P. 6(e) 

U.S.  Department of Justice 

Second, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying 
crime.  Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper 
obstructive purpose, see, e.g. , United States v.  Willoughby,  860 F.2d  15, 24 (2d Cir.  1988), or that 
he  contemplated an effect on an  official  proceeding, see,  e.g.,  United States v.  Binday,  804 F.3d 
558, 591  (2d Cir. 2015).  But proof of such a crime is  not an  element of an obstruction offense. 
See United States v.  Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in applying the obstruction 
sentencing  guideline,  that  "obstruction  of a  criminal  investigation  is  punishable  even  if the 
prosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying 
crime").  Obstruction  of justice can  be  motivated  by a  desire  to  protect non-criminal  personal 
interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, 
or to avoid personal embarrassment.  The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same 
regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong. 

In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an 
underlying crime related to Russian election interference.  But the evidence does point to a range 
of other possible personal motives animating the President's conduct.  These include concerns that 
continued  investigation  would  call  into  question  the  legitimacy  of his  election  and  potential 
uncertainty  about  whether  certain  events-such  as  advance  notice  of WikiLeaks' s  release  of 
hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians(cid:173)
could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family. 

Third,  many  of the  President's  acts  directed  at witnesses,  including  discouragement of 
cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future  pardons, occurred in  public 
view.  While  it may  be  more  difficult  to  establish  that  public-facing acts  were  motivated  by a 
corrupt intent, the President's power to  influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his 
unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications.  And no  principle of law 
excludes public acts  from  the  scope of obstruction statutes.  If the  likely effect of the acts  is  to 
intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system's integrity is equally threatened. 

2.  Although  the  events  we  investigated  involved  discrete  acts- e.g.,  the  President's 
statement to Corney about the  Flynn investigation,  his  termination  of Corney, and his efforts to 
remove the Special Counsel-
it is important to view the President' s pattern of conduct as a whole. 
That pattern sheds light on the nature of the President' s acts and the inferences that can be drawn 
about his intent. 

a.  Our investigation found  multiple  acts  by the President that were capable of exetting 
undue  influence  over  law  enforcement  investigations,  including  the  Russian-interference  and 
obstruction investigations.  The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in 
which  the President sought to  use  his  official  power outside  of usual  channels.  These actions 
ranged  from  efforts  to  remove  the  Special  Counsel  and  to  reverse  the  effect  of the  Attorney 
General ' s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to 
direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.  Viewing 
the  acts  collectively  can  help  to  illuminate  their  significance.  For  example,  the  President' s 
direction to McGahn to  have the Special Counsel  removed was followed almost immediately by 
his  direction  to  Lewandowski  to  tell  the  Attorney  General  to  limit  the  scope  of the  Russia 
investigation to prospective election-interference only-a temporal connection that suggests that 
both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation. 

157

U.S. Department of Justice 

The President' s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is 
largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede 
to his requests.  Corney did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's 
prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI.  McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General 
that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's 
order.  Lewandowski and  Dearborn did  not deliver the  President' s  message  to  Sessions that he 
should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only.  And McGahn refused to 
recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special 
Counsel  removed, despite the President's multiple  demands that he  do  so.  Consistent with  that 
pattern,  the  evidence  we  obtained  would  not  support  potential  obstruction  charges  against the 
President's aides and associates beyond those already filed. 

b.  In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President's actions can 
be  divided  into two  distinct phases reflecting a  possible shift in the  President's motives.  In  the 
first phase, before the President fired Corney, the President had been assured that the FBI had not 
opened an  investigation of him personally.  The President deemed it critically important to make 
public  that he  was  not under investigation,  and  he  included  that information  in  his  termination 
letter to Corney after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful. 

Soon after he fired Corney, however, the President became aware that investigators were 
conducting an  obstruction-of-justice  inquiry  into  his  own  conduct.  That  awareness  marked  a 
significant  change  in  the  President's  conduct  and  the  start  of a  second  phase  of action.  The 
President  launched  public attacks on the investigation and individuals  involved  in  it  who could 
possess evidence adverse to  the President, while  in  private, the President engaged in  a series of 
targeted efforts to control the investigation.  For instance, the President attempted to remove the 
Special  Counsel;  he sought  to  have  Attorney  General  Sessions  unrecuse  himself and  limit the 
investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting 
between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses 
who might offer adverse information and to  praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the 
government.  Judgments about the  nature of the President's motives during each phase would be 
informed by the totality of the evidence.

III.  LEGAL DEFENSES To THE APPLICATION  OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES  To 

THE PRESIDENT 

The  President's  personal  counsel  has  written  to  this  Office  to  advance  statutory  and 
constitutional  defenses  to  the  potential  application  of the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes  to  the 
President's  conduct. 1072  As  a  statutory  matter,  the  President's  counsel  has  argued  that  a  core 
obstruction-of-justice statute,  18  U.S.C.  § 1512( c )(2), does not cover the President' s  actions.1073 
As a constitutional matter, the President' s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice 
by exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate 
the FBI Director. 1074  Under that view, any statute that restricts the President' s exercise of those 
powers  would  impermissibly  intrude  on  the  President's  constitutional  role.  The  President's 
counsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve 
exercises  of his  Article  JI  authority,  such  as  laws  prohibiting  bribing witnesses  or  suborning 
perjury.1075  But counsel  has made  a  categorical  argument  that "the President's  exercise  of his 
constitutional  authority  here  to  terminate  an  FBI  Director  and  to  close  investigations  cannot 
constitutionally constitute obstruction of justice." 1076 

In  analyzing counsel 's statutory arguments,  we  concluded  that the President's proposed 
interpretation  of Section  1512(c)(2)  is  contrary to the  litigating  position  of the  Department  of 
Justice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction. 

As for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the 
courts  have  not  definitively  resolved  these  constitutional  issues.  We  therefore  analyzed  the 
President's position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation 
of powers.  Under  that  framework,  we  concluded,  Article  IT  of the  Constitution  does  not 
categorically and permanently immunize the President from  potential liability for the conduct that 
we investigated.  Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can

validly prohibit a President's corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere 
with an  investigation. 

A. 

Statutory Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-Of-Justice Provisions to 
the Conduct Under Investigation 

The obstruction-of-justice statute most readily applicable to our investigation is  18 U.S.C. 

§ 1512( c )(2).  Section  I 512( c) provides: 

(c) Whoever corruptly-

(!) alters,  destroys,  mutilates,  or conceals a  record,  document, or other object,  or 
attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for 
use in an official proceeding; or 

(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts 
to do so, 

shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 

The  Department  of Justice  has  taken  the  position  that  Section  1512( c )(2)  states  a  broad, 
independent,  and  unqualified  prohibition  on  obstruction  of justice.1077  While  defendants  have 
argued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability 
or integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(l)'s focus, strong arguments weigh against 
that proposed limitation.  The text of Section 1512( c )(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to 
Section  1512( c )(1 );  courts have so interpreted  it;  its  history  does not counsel otherwise; and no 
principle  of statutory  construction  dictates  a  contrary  view.  On  its  face,  therefore,  Section 
1512( c )(2) applies to all  corrupt means  of obstructing a  proceeding, pending or contemplated(cid:173)
including by improper exercises of official power.  In addition, other statutory provisions that are 
potentially  applicable  to  certain  conduct  we  investigated  broadly  prohibit  obstruction  of 
proceedings that are pending before courts,  grand juries, and Congress.  See  18 U.S.C. §§  1503, 
1505.  Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering.  See  18 U .S.C. § 1512(6 ). 

I.  The Text of Section  I 5 l 2{c){2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts 

Several textual  features  of Section  1512( c )(2)  support the conclusion that the  provision 
broadly  prohibits corrupt  means of obstructing justice  and  is  not limited  by  the more  specific 
prohibitions in Section  1512( c )(I), which focus on evidence impairment. 

First,  the  text  of Section  1512( c )(2)  is  unqualified: 

it  reaches  acts  that  "obstruct[], 
influence[], or impede[] any official proceeding" when committed "corruptly."  Nothing in Section 
1512(c)(2)'s  text  limits  the  provision  to  acts  that would  impair the  integrity  or  availability  of 
evidence for use in  an official proceeding.  In contrast, Section 1512(c)(I) explicitly includes the 
requirement that the defendant act "with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability 

1077  See  U.S.  Br.,  United States  v. Kumar, Nos. 06- 5482-cr(L), 06-5654-cr(CON) (2d Cir.  filed 
Oct. 26, 2007), at pp.  15-28; United States v.  Singleton, Nos. H-04-CR-514SS, H-06-cr-80 (S.D. Tex. filed 
June 5, 2006).

Atten1ey '.llerlc Preelttet // Ma)'1 Cei,taif'I Material Preteeteel Ui,eler Feel. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

for use in an official proceeding," a requirement that Congress also included in  two other sections 
of Section  1512.  See  18 U.S.C. §§  1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with  intent to cause a 
person to destroy an object "with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use 
in  an  official  proceeding");  1512(6 )(2)(B)  (use  of intimidation,  threats,  corrupt  persuasion,  or 
misleading  conduct with  intent to  cause  a  person  to  destroy  an  object "with  intent to impair the 
integrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding").  But no comparable intent 
or conduct element focused  on  evidence  impairment appears  in  Section  1512( c )(2).  The intent 
element  in  Section  l 512(c)(2)  comes  from  the  word  "corruptly."  See,  e.g.,  United .States  v. 
McKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711  (7th Cir. 2011) ("The intent element is important because the word 
' corruptly'  is  what  serves  to  separate  criminal  and  innocent  acts  of obstruction.")  (internal 
quotation  marks  omitted).  And  the  conduct  element  in  Section  1512( c )(2)  is  "obstruct[ing], 
influenc[ing],  or imped[ing]" a proceeding.  Congress is presumed to have acted  intentionally in 
the disparate  inclusion and exclusion  of evidence-impairment language.  See Loughrin v.  United 
States,  573 U.S. 351 , 358 (2014) ("[W]hen 'Congress includes particular language in  one section 
of a statute but om its it in another' -let alone in the very next provision-
th is Court ' presume[ s]' 
that Congress intended a difference in meaning") (quoting Russello v.  United States, 464 U.S.  16, 
23  (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust,  Inc.  v.  Somers,  138 S. Ct.  767, 777(2018). 

Second,  the  structure  of Section  1512  supports  the  conclusion  that  Section  1512( c )(2) 
defines  an  independent offense.  Section  1512(c)(2) delineates  a  complete  crime  with  different 
elements  from  Section  I 5 I 2(c)(I )-and each  subsection  of Section  1512(c)  contains  its  own 
"attempt" prohibition, underscoring that they are  independent prohibitions.  The two subsections 
of Section  1512(c)  are  connected  by  the  conjunction  "or,"  indicating  that  each  provides  an 
alternative  basis for criminal  liability.  See Loughrin, 573 U.S.  at 357 ("ordinary use  [of ' or']  is 
almost  always  disjunctive,  that  is,  the  words  it  connects  are  to  be  given  separate  meanings") 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use 
of the word "or" to hold  that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud  statute,  18 
U .S.C.  § 1344,  state  distinct  offenses  and  that  subsection  1344(2)  therefore  should  not  be 
interpreted to  contain  an  additional  element specified only  in  subsection  1344(1 ).  Id.;  see  also 
Shaw  v.  United States,  137 S.  Ct.  462, 465-469  (2016)  (recognizing that the  subsections  of the 
bank  fraud  statute  "overlap  substantially"  but  identifying  distinct  circumstances  covered  by 
each). 1078  And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)'s "two clauses have separate numbers,  line 
breaks  before,  between,  and  after  them,  and  equivalent  indentation-thus  placing  the  clauses 
visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings."  573 U.S. at 359. 

Third, the  introductory word "otherwise" in  Section  1512( c )(2) signals that the provision 
covers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512( c )(I).  See Black's Law 
Dictionary  1101  (6th ed.  1990) ("otherwise" means "in  a different manner; in another way, or in 
other ways"); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online ("I.  In another way; 

1078  The Office  of Legal Counsel  recently relied on several  of the same  interpretive principles in 
concluding that language that appeared in the first clause of the  Wire Act,  18 U.S.C. §  I 084, restricting its 
prohibition against certain betting or wagering activities to "any sporting event or contest," did not apply 
to  the  second  clause  of the  same  statute,  which  reaches  other  betting  or  wagering  activities.  See 
Reconsidering Whether the  Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports  Gambling (Nov.  2, 2018), slip op.  7 (relying

differently;  2.  Under other circumstances"); see also Gooch v.  United States,  297 U.S.  124,  128 
(1936) (characterizing "otherwise" as a "broad term" and holding that a statutory prohibition  on 
kidnapping  "for  ransom  or  reward  or  otherwise"  is  not  limited  by  the  words  "ransom"  and 
"reward" to kidnappings for pecuniary benefits); Collazos v.  United States, 368 F.3d 190,200 (2d 
Cir.  2004)  (construing  "otherwise"  in  28  U.S.C.  §  2466(l)(C)  to  reach  beyond  the  "specific 
examples" listed  in prior subsections, thereby covering the "myriad means that human ingenuity 
might devise to  permit a person to avoid the jurisdiction of a court"); cf Begay v.  United States, 
553 U.S.  137,  144 (2006) (recognizing that "otherwise" is defined to mean " in a different way or 
manner," and  holding  that the word  "otherwise"  introducing the  residual  clause  in  the  Armed 
Career Criminal Act,  18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), can, but need not necessarily, "refer to a crime 
that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others"). 1079  The purpose of 
the  word  "otherwise"  in  Section  1512( c )(2)  is  therefore  to  clarify  that  the  provision  covers 
obstructive  acts  other  than  the  destruction  of physical  evidence  with  the  intent  to  impair  its 
integrity  or  availability,  which  is  the  conduct  addressed  in  Section  l 5 l 2(c)( I).  The  word 
"otherwise"  does  not  signal  that  Section  1512( c )(2)  has  less  breadth  in  covering  obstructive 
conduct than the language of the provision implies. 

2.  Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(c)(2) 

Courts  have not limited Section  1512( c )(2) to conduct that impairs evidence,  but instead 

have read it to  cover obstructive acts in any form. 

As  one  court  explained,  " [t]his  expansive  subsection  operates  as  a  catch-all  to  cover 
'otherwise' obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document 
destruction, which is listed in (c)(l)."  United States v.  Volpendesto,  746 F.3d 273,  286 (7th Cir. 
2014) (some quotation  marks omitted).  For example, in  United States v.  Ring, 628 F.  Supp. 2d 
195  (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argument that"§  1512( c )(2)'s reference to conduct that 
'otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding'  is  limited to conduct that is 
similar to the type of conduct proscribed  by subsection (c)(l)-namely, conduct that impairs the 
integrity  or  availability  of 'record[s],  documents[s],  or  other  object[s]  for  use  in  an  official 
proceeding."  Id.  at 224.  The  court explained that "the  meaning of§ 1512(c)(2)  is  plain on  its 
face."  Id.  (alternations in original).  And courts have upheld convictions under Section l 512(c)(2) 
that did  not involve evidence impairment,  but instead  resulted  from  conduct that more  broadly 
thwarted arrests or investigations.  See, e.g., United States v.  Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 
2017)  (police officer tipped  off suspects  about  issuance of arrest warrants  before  "outstanding 
warrants  could  be  executed,  thereby  potentially  interfering  with  an  ongoing  grand  jury 
proceeding");  United States v.  Ahrensfield,  698 F.3d  1310,  1324-1326 (10th Cir.  2012)  (officer 
disclosed existence of an undercover investigation to its target); United States v.  Phillips, 583 F .3d 
1261 , 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) ( defendant disclosed identity of an undercover officer thus preventing 
him  from  making  controlled  purchases from  methamphetamine  dealers).  Those cases illustrate, 
that Section  1512(c)(2) applies  to corrupt acts-
including by public officials-that frustrate the 

1079 In Sykes v.  United States,  564 U.S.  1, 15  (2011 ),  the  Supreme Court  substantially abandoned 
Begay's reading of the residual clause, and in Johnson v.  United States,  135  S.  Ct. 2551  (2015), the Court 
invalidated the  residual  clause as  unconstitutionally vague.  Begay' s analysis of the  word "otherwise" is 
thus of limited value.

commencement or conduct of a proceeding, and not just to acts that make evidence unavailable or 
impair its integrity. 

Section 1512(c)(2)'s breadth is  reinforced by the similarity of its language to the omnibus 
clause of 18 U.S.C.  §  1503,  which  covers  anyone who "corruptly  ... obstructs, or impedes,  or 
endeavors to  influence,  obstruct, or impede, the  due  administration  of justice."  That clause of 
Section 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors, judges, and court officers.  The 
omnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to be "far more general  in  scope than the earlier 
clauses of the statute."  United States v.  Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995).  "The omnibus clause 
is essentially a  catch-all  provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due 
administration of justice."  United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997).  Courts 
have accordingly given it a "non-restrictive reading."  United States v. Kumar, 617 F .3d 612, 620 
(2d Cir. 201 O); id. at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh 
Circuits).  As one court has explained, the omnibus clause "prohibits acts that are similar in result, 
rather  than  manner,  to  the  conduct described  in  the  first  part  of the  statute."  United States  v. 
Howard,  569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir.  1978).  While the specific clauses "forbid certain means 
of obstructing justice ... the omnibus clause aims at obstruction of justice itself, regardless of the 
means used to reach that result."  Id.  ( collecting cases).  Given the similarity of Section 1512( c )(2) 
to Section 1503 's omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts 
that produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions-i.e., the result of obstructing 
justice-rather than  covering  only  acts  that  were  similar  in  manner.  Read  this  way,  Section 
1512( c )(2)  serves  a  distinct  function  in  the  federal  obstruction-of-justice  statutes: 
it  captures 
corrupt  conduct,  other  than  document  destruction,  that  has  the  natural  tendency  to  obstruct 
contemplated as well as pending proceedings. 

Section  1512( c )(2)  overlaps with other  obstruction  statutes,  but  it  does  not render them 
Section  1503,  for  example,  which  covers  pending  grand  jury  and  judicial 
superfluous. 
proceedings,  and  Section  1505,  which  covers  pending  administrative  and  congressional 
proceedings, reach "endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede" the proceedings-a broader test 
for inchoate violations than Section  1512(c)(2)'s "attempt" standard, which requires a substantial 
step towards a completed offense.  See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287,302 (2d Cir.2018) 
("[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level  of an  ' endeavor'  yet fall  short of an  'attempt' 
cannot be prosecuted under§  1512.");  United States v.  Leisure, 844 F.2d  1347,  1366-1367 (8th 
Cir.  1988)  (collecting  cases recognizing  the  difference  between  the  "endeavor"  and  "attempt" 
standards).  And  18  U.S.C.  §  1519,  which  prohibits  destruction  of documents  or records  in 
contemplation  of an  investigation  or  proceeding,  does  not require  the  "nexus"  showing  under 
Aguilar, which Section  1512( c )(2) demands.  See,  e.g.,  United States v.  Yielding,  657 F .3d  688, 
712 (8th Cir.2011) ("The requisite knowledge and intent [ under Section 1519] can be present even 
if the  accused  lacks  knowledge  that he  is  likely  to  succeed  in  obstructing the  matter.");  United 
States v.  Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d  Cir.  2011) ("[I]n enacting§  1519, Congress rejected 
any requirement that the government prove a link between a defendant's conduct and an imminent 
or pending official proceeding.").  The existence of even "substantial" overlap is not "uncommon" 
in criminal statutes.  Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515 
U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The fact that there  is  now some overlap between§  1503  and 
§ 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause 
of§ 1503  and the other provisions of§  1503  itself.").  But given that Sections  1503,  1505,  and 

163

1519 each reach conduct that Section  1512( c )(2) does not, the overlap provides no reason to give 
Section 1512( c )(2) an artificially limited construction.  See Shaw,  13 7 S. Ct. at 469. 1080 

3.  The Legislative History of Section  l512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing Its 

Text 

"Given the straightforward statutory command" in  Section  l512(c)(2), "there is no reason 
to resort to legislative history."  United States v.  Gonzales, 520 U.S.  1, 6 (1997).  In any event, the 
legislative  history of Section  1512(c)(2)  is  not a  reason  to  impose extratextual  limitations on  its 
reach. 

Congress enacted Section 1512( c )(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 
107-204,  Tit.  XI,  §  1102,  116  Stat.  807. 
The  relevant  section  of the  statute  was  entitled 
"Tampering  with  a  Record  or  Otherwise  Impeding  an  Official  Proceeding."  116  Stat.  807 
( emphasis added).  That title indicates that Congress intended the two clauses to have independent 
effect.  Section 1512( c) was added as a floor amendment in  the Senate and explained as closing a 
certain "loophole" with respect to "document shredding."  See  148 Cong. Rec.  S6545  (July  I 0, 
2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at S6549-S6550 (Sen: Hatch).  But those explanations do not limit the enacted 
text.  See  Pittston Coal Group  v.  Sebben,  488 U.S.  105,  115  (1988) ("[l]t is  not the  law that a 
statute can have  no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history."); see also 
Encino  Motorcars,  LLC v.  Navarro,  138  S.  Ct.  1134,  1143  (20 18)  ("Even  if Congress did  not 
foresee  all  of the applications of the statute, that is  no reason  not to give the statutory text a  fair 
reading.").  The floor statements thus cannot detract from  the meaning of the  enacted text.  See 
Barnhart  v.  Sigmon  Coal Co.,  534 U.S.  438,  457 (2002) ("Floor statements  from  two  Senators 
.cannot amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute.  We see no reason to give greater 
weight  to  the  views  of two  Senators  than  to  the  collective  votes  of both  Houses,  which  are 
memorialized in the unambiguous statutory text.").  That principle has particular force where one 
of the  proponents  of the  amendment  to  Section  1512  introduced  his  remarks  as  only  "briefly 
elaborat[ing] on some of the  specific provisions contained  in  this  bill."  148 Cong.  Rec.  S6550 
(Sen. Hatch). 

Indeed,  the  language  Congress  used  in  Section  1512( c )(2)-prohibiting "corruptly  ... 

obstruct[ing],  influenc[ing],  or  imped[ing]  any  official  proceeding"  or  attempting  to  do  so-(cid:173)
parallels  a  provision  that  Congress  considered  years  earlier  in  a  bill  designed  to  strengthen 
protections against witness tampering and obstruction of justice.  While the earlier provision is not 
a  direct antecedent of Section  15 12(c)(2),  Congress's  understanding  of the broad  scope of the 

1080 The Supreme Court's decision in Marinello v.  United States,  138 S. Ct.  1101  (2018), does not 
support imposing a non-textual limitation on Section I 512(c)(2).  Marinello interpreted the tax obstruction 
statute,  26  U.S.C.  §  7212(a),  to  require  "a  ' nexus'  between  the  defendant's  conduct  and  a  particular 
administrative  proceeding."  Id.  at  1109.  The  Court  adopted  that  construction  in  light of the  similar 
interpretation given to "other obstruction provisions," id.  (citing Aguilar and Arthur Andersen), as well as 
considerations of context, legislative history, structure of the criminal tax laws, fair warning, and lenity.  Id. 
at 1106-1108.  The type of "nexus" element the Court adopted in Marinello already applies under Section 
1512(c)(2), and the remaining considerations the Court cited do not justify reading into Section  l 512(c)(2) 
language that is not there.  See Bates v.  United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29 ( 1997) (the Court "ordinarily resist[ s] 
reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.").

U.S. Department of Justice 

earlier provision  is  instructive.  Recognizing  that "the  proper administration  of justice may be 
impeded or thwarted" by a "variety of corrupt methods ... limited only by the imagination of the 
criminally inclined," S.  Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.  17-18 (1982), Congress considered a 
bill  that  would  have  amended  Section  1512  by  making  it  a  crime,  inter  alia,  when  a  person 
"corruptly .. . influences, obstructs, or impedes . . . [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal 
law," "administration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted," 
or the "exercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry."  Id.  at 17-19 ( quoting S. 2420). 

The Senate Committee explained that: 

[T]he  purpose  of preventing  an  obstruction  of or  miscarriage  of justice cannot be  fully 
carried  out by  a  simple  enumeration  of the  commonly prosecuted  obstruction  offenses. 
There must also  be protection against the  rare type  of conduct that is the product of the 
inventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice. 

Id.  at  18.  The report gave examples of conduct " actually  prosecuted under the current residual 
clause [in  18 U.S.C. § 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions] 
without a  residual  clause."  Id.  One  prominent example was  " [a]  conspiracy  to  cover up  the 
Watergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere 
with an ongoing FBI investigation  of the burglary."  Id.  (citing  United States v.  Haldeman,  559 
F.2d 31  (D.C. Cir.  1976)).  The report therefore  indicates a congressional awareness not only that 
residual-clause  language  resembling  Section  1512( c )(2)  broadly  covers  a  wide  variety  of 
obstructive  conduct,  but  also  that  such  language  reaches  the  improper  use  of governmental 
processes to obstruct justice-specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House 
officials including the President himself.  See Haldeman, 559 F .3d at 51, 86-87,  120-129, 162.1081 

4.  General  Principles  of Statutory  Construction  Do  Not  Suggest  That  Section 

1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation 

The  requirement  of fair  warning  in  criminal  law,  the  interest  in  avoiding  due  process 
concerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of 
Section 1512( c )(2) ' s text. 1082 

a.  As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has "exercised restraint" in interpreting 
obstruction-of-justice provisions, both out ofrespect for Congress's role in defining crimes and in 
the  interest  of providing  individuals  with  " fair  warning"  of what  a  criminal  statute  prohibits. 
Marinello  v.  United States,  138  S.  Ct.  1101 ,  1106  (2018);  Arthur Andersen,  544  U.S.  at 703; 

1081  The  Senate  ultimately  accepted  the  House  version  of the  bill,  which  excluded  an  omnibus 
clause.  See  United States v.  Poindexter,  951  F.2d 369,  382-383  (D.C. Cir.  1991) (tracing  history  of the 
proposed  omnibus  provision  in  the witness-protection  legislation).  During  the  floor debate  on  the  bill, 
Senator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause 
was  beyond  the  scope  of the  witness-protection  measure  at  issue  and  likely  "duplicative"  of other 
obstruction laws,  128 Cong.  Rec.  26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz),  presumably referring to  Sections  1503  and 
1505. 

1082 In a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles 

of statutory construction relevant in that context.  See Volume Tl,  Section III.B.l, infra.

U.S. Department of Justice 

Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602.  In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that 
requires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official 
proceeding to ensure the  requisite culpability.  Marinello,  138 S.  Ct.  at  1109; Arthur Andersen, 
544  U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar,  515 U .S. at 600-602.  Section  1512(c)(2) has  been  interpreted to 
require a  similar nexus.  See,  e.g.,  United States  v.  Young,  916 F.3d  368,  386 (4th  Cir.  2019); 
United States v.  Petruk,  781  F .3d 438,  445  (8th  Cir.  2015);  United States v.  Phillips,  583  F.3d 
1261,  1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 4 79 F .3d 179,  186 (2d Cir. 2007).  To satisfy 
the nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a  defendant acted 
"in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice," such that the statute " excludes defendants who have 
an  evil  purpose  but  use  means  that  would  only  unnaturally  and  improbably  be  successful." 
Aguilar,  515  U.S.  at  601-602 (internal  quotation  marks omitted);  see  id.  at 599  ("the  endeavor 
must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with  the  due  administration of justice") 
(internal  quotation marks omitted).  The government must also show as a  subjective matter that 
the  actor "contemplated  a  particular,  foreseeable  proceeding."  Petruk, 781  F.3d at 445.  Those 
requirements  alleviate  fair-warning  concerns  by  ensuring  that  obstructive  conduct has  a  close 
enough  connection  to  existing  or  future  proceedings  to  implicate  the  dangers  targeted  by  the 
obstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind. 

b.  Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns.  See, e.g., 
McDonnell v.  United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v.  United States, 561  U.S. 358, 
368, 402-404 (2010).  Vagueness doctrine  requires that a  statute define a  crime " with sufficient 
definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited" and " in a manner that 
does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement."  Id.  at 402-403 (internal quotation 
marks omitted).  The obstruction statutes' requirement of acting "corruptly" satisfies that test. 

"Acting 'corruptly'  within  the  meaning of§  1512(c)(2)  means acting with  an  improper 
purpose and to engage in  conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the  specific  intent to subvert, 
impede or obstruct" the relevant proceeding.  United States v. Gordon, 710 F .3d 1 124,  I 151  (10th 
Cir. 2013) (some quotation  marks omitted).  The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the 
defendant's vagueness challenge to the word "corruptly," 515 U.S. at 600 n.  1, but Justice Scalia's 
separate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id.  at 616-617 (Scalia, 
J., joined  by Kennedy  and  Thomas,  JJ.,  concurring  in  part and  dissenting  in  part).  "Statutory 
language  need  not be colloquial," Justice  Scalia explained, and "the term  ' corruptly'  in  criminal 
laws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning.  It denotes an act done with an  intent to give 
some  advantage  inconsistent  with  official  duty  and  the  rights  of others." 
Id.  at  616  (internal 
quotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries).  Justice Scalia added 
that "in  the  context of obstructing jury proceedings,  any  claim  of ignorance  of wrongdoing  is 
incredible."  Id.  at  617.  Lower  courts  have  also  rejected  vagueness  challenges  to  the  word 
"corruptly."  See, e.g., United States v.  Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir.  2017);  United 
States v. Brenson,  104 F.3d  1267,  1280-1281  (11th Cir.  1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 
1331,  1336 n.9  (5th Cir.  1978).  This well-established intent standard precludes the need to  limit 
the obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.1083 

1083  In  United States v.  Poindexter, 951  F .2d 369 (D.C.  Cir.  1991 ), the court of appeals found the 
term  "corruptly"  in  18  U.S.C.  §  1505  vague  as  applied  to  a  person  who  provided  false  information  to 
Congress.  After suggesting that the  word "corruptly"  was vague  on  its face,  951  F.2d  at 378, the court

U.S. Department of Justice 

c.  Finally, the rule of lenity does not justify treating Section  1512( c )(2) as a prohibition on 
evidence  impairment,  as  opposed  to  an  omnibus  clause.  The  rule  of lenity  is  an  interpretive 
principle  that  resolves  ambiguity  in  criminal  laws  in  favor  of the  less-severe  construction. 
Cleveland v.  United States, 531 U.S.  12, 25 (2000).  "[ A ]s [the Court has] repeatedly emphasized," 
however, the rule of lenity applies only if, "after considering text, structure,  history and purpose, 
there remains a  grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must simply 
guess as to what Congress intended."  Abramski v.  United States,  573 U.S.  169,  188 n. 10 (2014) 
(internal quotation  marks omitted).  The rule has  been cited, for example,  in adopting a  narrow 
meaning of"tangible object" in an obstruction statute when the prohibition's title, history, and list 
of prohibited acts indicated a  focus on destruction of records.  See  Yates v.  United States,  135 S. 
Ct.  1074,  1088  (2015)  (plurality  opinion)  (interpreting "tangible  object"  in  the  phrase "record, 
document,  or  tangible  object"  in  18  U.S.C.  §  1519  to  mean  an  item  capable  of recording  or 
preserving  information).·  Here,  as  discussed  above,  the  text,  structure,  and  history  of Section 
l 5 I 2(c)(2)  leaves  no  "grievous  ambiguity"  about  the  statute's  meaning.  Section  l 512(c)(2) 
defines a  structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings. 

5.  Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation 

Regardless whether Section  1512( c )(2) covers all  corrupt acts that obstruct,  influence, or 
impede  pending  or contemplated  proceedings,  other  statutes  would  apply  to  such  conduct  in 
pending proceedings,  provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied.  As discussed 
above,  the omnibus clause  in  18  U.S.C.  § 1503(a)  applies  generally to  obstruction  of pending 
judicial and grand  proceedings. 1084  See Aguilar, 515 U.S.  at  598 (noting that  the  clause is "far 
more  general  in  scope"  than  preceding  provisions).  Section  I 503(a)'s  protections  extend  to 
witness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings.  See 
Sampson,  898 F.3d at 298-303  &  n.6 (collecting cases from  eight circuits  holding  that Section 
1503  covers  witness-related  obstructive  conduct,  and  cabining  prior  circuit  authority).  And 
Section 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional 
proceedings.1085  See, e.g.,  United States v.  Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014). 

concluded that the statute did not clearly apply to  corrupt conduct by  the person himself and  the "core" 
conduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was one person influencing another person 
to  violate a  legal  duty.  Id.  at  379-386.  Congress  later  enacted  a  provision  overturning that  result  by 
providing that "[a]s used  in [S]ection  1505, the term  'corruptly' means acting with an  improper purpose, 
personally or by  influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, 
concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information."  18 U.S.C.  §  1515(b).  Other courts 
have declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in 
that case, see Brenson,  104 F.3d at 1280-1281 ; reading it as narrowly limited to ce1tain types of conduct, 
see United States v.  Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir.  I 996); or by noting that it predated Arthur 
Andersen' s interpretation of the term "corruptly," see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502. 

1084  Section  \ 503(a) provides for criminal punishment of: 

Whoever  ... corruptly  or  by  threats  or  force,  or by  any  threatening  letter  or 
communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to  influence, obstruct, or 
impede, the due administration of justice. 

1085  Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of:

Finally,  18  U.S.C.  §  l 512(b)(3)  criminalizes  tampering  with  witnesses  to  prevent  the 
communication of information about a crime to law enforcement.  The nexus inquiry articulated 
in  Aguilar-that an  individual  has  "knowledge  that his  actions  are  likely  to  affect  the  judicial 
proceeding," 515 U.S. at 599- does not apply to Section 1512(6)(3).  See  United States v.  Byrne, 
435 F .3d I 6, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2006).  The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor's intent to prevent 
communications to a federal law enforcement official.  See Fowler v.  United States, 563 U.S. 668, 
673-678 (2011 ).

In  sum, in  light of the breadth of Section  1512( c )(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an 
argument that the conduct at issue  in  th is  investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction 
laws lacks merit. 

B. 

Constitutional  Defenses  to  Applying  Obstruction-Of-Justice  Statutes  to 
Presidential Conduct 

The President has broad discretion to direct criminal investigations.  The Constitution vests 
the "executive Power" in  the President and enjoins him to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully 
executed."  U.S.  CONST.  ART  IT,  §§  1,  3.  Those  powers  and  duties  form  the  foundation  of 
prosecutorial  discretion.  See  United States  v.  Armstrong,  517 U.S.  456,  464  (1996)  (Attorney 
General and United States Attorneys "have this  latitude because they are designated by statute as 
the President's delegates to help him  discharge his constitutional responsibility to ' take Care that 
the Laws be  faithfully  executed."').  The President also  has authority to  appoint officers of the 
United States and to remove those whom he has appointed.  U .S. CONST. ART II,§ 2, cl. 2 (granting 
authority to the  President to  appoint all  officers  with  the advice and consent of the  Senate,  but 
providing that Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in  the President alone,  the 
heads of departments,  or the courts of law); see also Free  Enterprise Fund v.  Public  Company 
Accounting Oversight Board, 561  U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as 
flowing from the President's "responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed"). 

Although the  President has  broad authority under Article II, that authority  coexists with 
Congress's  Article  I  power  to  enact  laws  that  protect  congressional  proceedings,  federal 
investigations,  the courts,  and  grand juries against corrupt efforts to  undermine their functions. 
Usually,  those  constitutional  powers  function  in  harmony,  with  the  President  enforcing  the 
criminal laws under Article IT to protect against corrupt obstructive acts.  But when the President' s 
official  actions  come  into  conflict  with  the  prohibitions  in  the  obstruction  statutes,  any 
constitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powers analysis. 

Whoever corruptly ... influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, 
obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending 
proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due 
and  proper exercise of the  power of inquiry  under which  any  inquiry  or  investigation  is 
being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the 
Congress.

U.S. Department of Justice 

The  President's  counsel  has  argued  that  "the President' s  exercise  of his  constitutional 
authority ... to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations ... cannot constitutionally 
constitute  obstruction  of justice."1086  As  noted  above,  no  Department  of Justice  position  or 
Supreme  Court  precedent directly  resolved  this  issue.  We  did  not  find  counsel's  contention, 
however,  to  accord  with  our reading of the  Supreme  Court authority  addressing separation-of(cid:173)
powers issues.  Applying  the  Court's framework  for analysis,  we  concluded that Congress  can 
validly regulate the President's exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt 
intent to obstruct justice.  The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction 
would not impermissibly undermine the President's ability to perform his Article II functions. 

1.  The  Requirement  of a  Clear  Statement  to  Apply  Statutes  to  Presidential 

Conduct Does Not Limit the Obstruction Statutes 

Before  addressing  Article  II  issues  directly,  we  consider  one  threshold  statutory(cid:173)

construction principle that is unique to the presidency:  "The principle that general statutes must 
be  read  as not applying to the President if they do  not expressly apply where application would 
arguably  limit  the  President's  constitutional  role."  OLC,  Application  of 28  USC.  § 458  to 
Presidential  Appointments  of Federal  Judges,  19  Op.  O.L.C.  350,  352  (1995).  This  "clear 
statement rule," id.,  has its source in two principles:  statutes should be construed to avoid serious 
constitutional questions,  and Congress should not be assumed to have altered  the  constitutional 
separation of powers without clear assurance that it intended that result.  OLC, The Constitutional 
Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124,  178 (1996). 

The Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases.  In one leading 
case, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  § 701  et seq.,  not to apply 
to judicial review of presidential action.  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992). 
The Court explained that it "would require  an express statement by Congress before assuming it 
intended the President's performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion." 
Id.  at 801.  In  another case,  the  Court  interpreted  the  word  "utilized"  in  the Federal  Advisory 
Comm ittee  Act  (F ACA),  5  U.S.C.  App.,  to  apply  only  to  the  use  of advisory  committees 
established  directly  or  indirectly  by  the  government,  thereby  excluding  the  American  Bar 
Association's advice to the Department of Justice about federal judicial candidates.  Public Citizen 
v. United States Department of Justice, 491  U.S. 440, 455 , 462-467 (1989).  The Court explained 
that a broader interpretation of the term " utilized" in F ACA would raise serious questions whether 
the statute " infringed  unduly  on the President's Article II  power to nominate federal judges and 
violated  the  doctrine  of separation  of powers."  Id.  at  466-467.  Another  case  found  that  an 
established canon of statutory construction applied with "special force"  to provisions that would 
impinge on the President's foreign-affairs  powers  if construed broadly.  Sale  v.  Haitian  Centers 
Council, 509 U.S.  155,  188 ( 1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application 
to construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an  overseas context where it could affect 
"foreign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility").  See Application

of 28  U.S.C.  §  458  to  Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges,  19  Op.  O.L.C.  at  353-354 
(discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale). 

The Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to  interpret certain 
statutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin.  See, e.g., 
Memorandum  for  Richard  T.  Burress,  Office  of the  President,  from  Laurence  H.  Silberman, 
Deputy  Attorney  General,  Re:  Conflict  of Interest  Problems  Arising out  of the  President's 
Nomination of Nelson A.  Rockefeller to be  Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to 
the  Constitution, at  2,  5  (Aug. 28,  1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute,  18 U.S.C.  §  208, 
does not apply to the President).  Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain 
presidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns.  See Application of 28 U.S. C. 
§ 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges,  19 Op.  O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity 
limitations  on  court  appointments,  28  U.S.C.  §  458,  found  inapplicable  to  "presidential 
appointments of judges to the federal judiciary"); Constraints Imposed by 18  U.S.C.  §  1913 on 
Lobbying Efforts,  13  Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds 
for certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and 
executive officials). 

But OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule "does not apply with respect to 
a statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President," such 
as  the federal  bribery statute,  18  U.S.C.  § 201.  Application of 28  U.S.C.  § 458 to  Presidential 
Appointments of Federal Judges,  19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11.  OLC explained that " [a]pplication 
of  §  20 I  raises  no  separation  of powers  question,  let  alone  a  serious  one,"  because  [t]he 
Constitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes."  Id.  In support of that conclusion, 
OLC noted constitutional  provisions that forbid  increases  in  the President's compensation while 
in office, "which is what a bribe would function to do," id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART. II,  § 1, cl. 7), 
and the express constitutional power of "Congress to impeach [and convict] a President for, inter 
alia, bribery," id.  (citing U.S. CONST. ART II,§ 4). 

Under OLC's analysis,  Congress can  permissibly criminalize ce1tain obstructive conduct 
by  the  President,  such  as  suborning  perjury,  intimidating  witnesses,  or  fabricating  evidence, 
because those prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions.  See Application of 28 U.S.C. 
§ 458  to  Presidential  Appointments  of Federal  Judges,  19  Op.  O.L.C.  at  357  n.11.  The 
Constitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would 
transgress the President's duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  U.S. CONST. 
ART IT,  §§ 3.  In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the 
President, Franklin's holding that the President is entirely excluded from  a statute absent a clear 
statement would not apply in this context. 

A more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes 
for example,  removing prosecutors or ending investigations 
only certain  acts  by the  President-
for corrupt reasons- would be difficult to  implement as a matter of statutory interpretation.  It is 
not  obvious  how  a  clear-statement  rule  would  apply  to  an  omnibus  provision  like  Section 
1512( c )(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President' s 
conduct of office.  No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning.  For example, the 
word "corruptly" has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power 
for corrupt ends.  Indeed, an established definition  states that "corruptly" means action with  an

U.S. Department of Justice 

intent to secure an  improper advantage "inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others." 
BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed.  1969) (emphasis added).  And  it would be contrary 
to ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaning of a statutory term 
only  when  applied  to  the  President.  See  United States  v.  Santos,  553  U.S.  507,  522  (2008) 
(plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to "giv[e] the same word, in the same statutory 
provision, different meanings in different factual contexts"); cf  Public Citizen, 491  U.S. at 462-
467 (giving the term "utilized" in the F ACA a uniform meaning to avoid constitutional questions). 
Nor  could  such  an  exclusion  draw  on  a  separate  and  established  background  interpretive 
presumption, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality applied in Sale.  The principle that 
courts  will  construe  a  statute  to  avoid  serious constitutional  questions " is  not a  license  for  the 
judiciary to  rewrite  language enacted  by the legislature."  Salinas v.  United States,  522 U.S.  52, 
59-60  ( 1997).  "It is  one  thing  to  acknowledge  and  accept  ... well  defined  ( or even  newly 
enunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumed legislative intent.  It is quite 
another to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly 
as they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions."  Brogan v.  United States, 522 U.S. 
398, 406 (1998). 

When a proposed construction "would thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute' s] 
compass," thereby preventing the statute "from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear 
terms," Loughrin,  573  U.S.  at 357,  it  is  doubtful  that the construction would  reflect  Congress's 
intent.  That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which "have been given a broad 
and all-inclusive meaning."  Rainey, 757 F .3d at 245 ( discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal 
quotation  marks omitted).  Accordingly,  since  no  established  principle  of interpretation  would 
exclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from  statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505, 
I 5 12(b),  and  l 512(c)(2),  we proceed to examine  the  separation-of-powers  issues that could  be 
raised as an Article II defense to the application of those statutes. 

2.  Separation-of-Powers  Principles  Support the Conclusion  that  Congress  May 
Validly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President's 
Official Powers 

When Congress imposes a  limitation on the exercise of Article II powers, the  limitation's 
validity depends on whether the measure "disrupts the balance between the coordinate branches." 
Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 443 (1977).  "Even when a branch does 
not arrogate power to itself, ... the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair 
another in  the  performance of its constitutional duties."  Loving v.  United States,  517 U.S.  748, 
757 (1996).  The "separation of powers does  not mean," however,  "that the  branches  'ought to 
have no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other."'  Clinton v.  Jones, 520 U.S. 
681,703 (1997) (quoting James Madison, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325-326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) 
(emphasis omitted)).  In this context, a balancing test applies to assess separation-of-powers issues. 
Applying  that  test  here,  we  concluded  that  Congress  can  validly  make  obstruction-of-justice 
statutes  applicable  to  corruptly  motivated  official  acts  of the  President w ithout  impermissibly 
undermining his Article II functions.

U.S. Department of Justice 

a.  The Supreme Court's Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies 

In This Context 

A  congressionally imposed limitation on presidential action is assessed to determine "the 
extent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned 
functions," and, if the "potential for disruption is present[,] ... whether that impact is justified by 
an  overriding  need  to  promote  objectives  within  the  constitutional  authority  of Congress." 
Administrator of General Services,  433  U.S. at 443; see Nixon v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 731,753-
754 (1982); United States v.  Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (l 974).  That balancing test applies to 
a congressional regulation of presidential power through the obstruction-of-justice laws. 1087 

When an Article II  power has not been "explicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution 
to  be within the sole province of the President,  but rather was thought to be encompassed within 
the  general  grant to the President of the  'executive Power,"' the  Court has  balanced competing 
constitutional  considerations.  Public  Citizen,  491  U.S.  at 484  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring  in  the 
judgment, joined  by  Rehnquist,  C.J.,  and  O 'Connor,  J.).  As  Justice  Kennedy noted  in  Public 
Citizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on "the President's power to remove 
Executive officers, a power [that] ... is not conferred by any explicit provision in  the text of the 
Constitution (as is the appointment power), but rather is inferred to be a necessary part of the grant 
of the 'executive Power."'  Id. (citing Morrison v.  Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (l 988), and Myers v. 
United States, 272 U.S. 52,  115-116 ( 1926)).  Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained 
a  good-cause  limitation  on  the  removal  of  an  inferior  officer  with  defined  prosecutorial 
responsibilities  after  determining  that  the  limitation  did  not  impermissibly  undermine  the 
President's ability to  perform his Article II functions.  487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696.  The Court 
has also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a  balancing test.  For example, 
the Court evaluated the President's claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications 
about his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch's need for evidence in 
a criminal case.  United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for 
presidential communications on  official matters).  The Court has also upheld a  law that provided 
for archival  access to presidential  records despite a  claim of absolute presidential  privilege over 
the records.  Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455.  The analysis in 
those  cases  supports  applying  a  balancing  test  to  assess  the  constitutionality  of applying  the 
obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power. 

Only in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework.  When the President's 
power is " both 'exclusive' and 'conclusive'  on  the issue,"  Congress is  precluded from  regulating 
its exercise.  Zivotofsky v.  Kerry,  I 35  S.  Ct.  2076, 2084  (2015).  In Zivotofsky, for example,  the 
Court followed "Justice Jackson' s familiar tripartite framework" in  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. 
v.  Sawyer,  343  U.S. 579, 635-638  (1952) (Jackson, J.,  concurring), and held that the President's 

1087  OLC applied such a balancing test in  concluding that the  President is  not subject to  criminal 
prosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section.  See A Sitting 
President's Amenability to  Indictment  and Criminal Prosecution,  24  Op.  O.L.C.  222,  237-238, 244-245 
(2000) (relying on, inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v.  Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting 
the  legal  standard  from  Administrator of General Services  v.  Nixon  that  is  applied  in  the  text).  OLC 
recognized  that  "[t]he  balancing analysis"  it had  initially  relied  on  in  finding that a  sitting  President is 
immune from  prosecution had "been adopted as the appropriate mode of analysis by the Court."  Id.  at 244. 

172 

At:terttey  \llerk Predttet // May Cetttaitt :Material Pfeteeted Uttder Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) 

U.S. Department of Justice 

authority to recognize foreign nations is exclusive.  Id. at 2083, 2094.  See also Public Citizen 491 
U.S. at 485-486 (Kennedy, J ., concurring in the judgment) ( citing the power to grant pardons under 
U.S. CONST., ART. TT,§  2, cl.  1,  and the  Presentment Clauses for legislation, U.S. CONST., ART. T, 
§ 7, Cls. 2, 3, as examples of exclusive presidential powers by virtue of constitutional text). 

But even when a  power is  exclusive, "Congress'  powers, and  its  central  role in  making 
laws,  give  it substantial authority  regarding many of the  policy determinations  that precede and 
follow" the President' s act.  Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087.  For example, although the President' s 
power to grant pardons is exclusive and not subject to congressional regulation, see United States 
v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147- 148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt 
use of"anything of value" to influence the testimony of another person in a judicial, congressional, 
or agency  proceeding,  18  U.S.C.  § 201(b)(3)-which would  include  the  offer or promise  of a 
pardon to induce a  person to testify  falsely or not to testify at all.  The offer of a  pardon would 
precede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress' s power to regulate even if the pardon 
itself is not.  Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 6, cl. I, absolutely protects 
legislative acts,  but not a  legislator' s "taking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in  a 
certain way ... for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal 
act," United States v. Brewster,  408  U.S. 501, 526 (1972)  ( emphasis omitted),  the promise of a 
pardon  to  corruptly  influence  testimony  would  not  be  a  constitutionally  immunized  act.  The 
application  of obstruction statutes  to  such  promises therefore would raise no serious separation(cid:173)
of-powers issue. 

b.  The  Effect  of Obstruction-of-Justice  Statutes  on  the  President's 

Capacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited 

Under the Supreme Court's balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers  issues, the 
first task  is  to assess  the  degree to  which  applying obstruction-of-justice statutes  to  presidential 
actions affects the President' s ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities.  Administrator of 
General Services, 433 U.S. at 443.  As discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes 
to presidential conduct that does not involve the President's conduct of office-such as influencing 
the testimony of witnesses-is constitutionally unproblematic.  The President has no  more  right 
than other citizens to impede official proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony.  The 
conduct would  be  equally  improper whether effectuated through  direct efforts  to  produce  false 
testimony  or suppress  the  truth,  or  through  the  actual,  threatened,  or  promised  use  of official 
powers to achieve the same result. 

The President's action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging 
law enforcement officials, raises different questions.  Each type of action involves the exercise of 
executive discretion in furtherance of the President's duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully 
executed."  U.S.  CONST.,  ART.  II,  § 3.  Congress  may  not  supplant the  President's exercise of 
executive  power to supervise  prosecutions  or to  remove  officers  who  occupy  law enforcement 
positions.  See  Bowsher v.  Synar,  478  U.S. 714,  726-727  (1986)  ("Congress  cannot reserve  for 
itself the  power  of removal  of an  officer  charged  with  the  execution  of the  laws  except  by 
impeachment. ... [Because t]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute 
the  laws,  ... [t]his  kind  of congressional  control  over  the  execution  of  the  laws  .. ·.  is 
constitutionally impermissible.").  Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not aggrandize power 
in  Congress  or usurp  executive authority.  Instead, they impose  a  discrete  limitation on conduct 

173

only when  it is  taken with the "corrupt"  intent to obstruct justice.  The obstruction statutes thus 
would restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official 
proceedings for  the  improper  purpose  of protecting  his  own  interests.  See  Volume  IT,  Section 
TII.A.3, supra. 

The direct effect on the President' s freedom of action would correspondingly be a  limited 
one.  A  preclusion of "corrupt" official  action  is not a major intrusion  on Article II  powers.  For 
example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act 
with the  intention of shielding himself from  criminal  punishment, avoiding financial  liability, or 
preventing  personal  embarrassment.  To  the  contrary,  a  statute  that  prohibits  official  action 
undertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded 
administration  of the  law.  And  the  Constitution  does  not  mandate  that  the  President  have 
unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever, in order to 
carry out his Article  II  functions.  See Heckler v.  Chaney, 4 70 U.S. 821 ,  833  ( 1985) ("Congress 
may limit an  agency' s  exercise of enforcement power if it wishes,  either by setting substantive 
priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency' s power to discriminate among issues or cases 
it  will  pursue.");  United States  v.  Nixon,  418  U.S.  at  707  (" [t]o  read  the  Art.  II  powers  of the 
President  as  providing an  absolute  privilege  [to  withhold  confidential  communications  from  a 
criminal trial] . .. would upset the constitutional balance of 'a workable government'  and gravely 
impair the role of the courts under Art. III"). 

Nor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials 
involved in the execution of the laws.  The Constitution establishes that Congress has  legislative 
authority  to  structure  the  Executive  Branch  by  authorizing  Congress  to  create  executive 
departments and  officer positions and  to specify how inferior officers are appointed.  E.g. , U.S. 
CONST., ART.  I,  § 8, cl.  18  (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II,  § 2, cl.  1 (Opinions Clause); 
ART. TI,  § 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free  Enterprise Fund,  561  U.S. at 499.  While the 
President' s removal  power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully  execute the 
law, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal.  Id.  at 493-495. 

The President's removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers-that 
is,  officers who  must  be appointed  by  the  President and  who  report to  him  directly.  See  Free 
Enterprise  Fund,  561  U.S.  at  493,  500.  The  President's "exclusive  and  illimitable  power  of 
removal"  of those  principal  officers furthers "the President's ability to ensure that the laws are 
faithfully  executed."  Id.  at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627. 
Thus, "there are some ' purely executive' officials who must be removable by the President at will 
if he is able to accomplish his constitutional role."  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at 
134 (the President' s "cabinet officers must do his will," and "[t]he moment that he loses confidence 
in  the  intelligence, ability, judgment,  or loyalty of any one of them,  he  must have the power to 
remove  him  without  delay"); cf Humphrey's Executor  v.  United States,  295  U.S.  602  (1935) 
(Congress has the power to create  independent agencies headed by principal officers removable 
only for  good cause).  In light of those constitutional  precedents, it may be that the obstruction 
statutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the 
Attorney  General.  See  5  U.S.C.  §  101;  28  U.S.C.  §  503. 
In  that  context,  at  least  absent 
circumstances  showing  that  the  President  was  clearly  attempting  to  thwart  accountability  for 
personal conduct while evading ordinary political checks and  balances,  even the highly limited

U.S. Department of Justice 

regulation imposed by the obstruction statutes could possibly intrude too deeply on the President's 
freedom to select and supervise the members of his cabinet. 

The removal of inferior officers, in contrast, need not necessarily be at will for the President 
to fulfill his constitutionally assigned role in  managing the Executive Branch.  "[I]nferior officers 
are officers whose work is  directed and  supervised at some level by other officers appointed by 
the President with the Senate's consent."  Free Enterprise Fund, 561  U.S. at 510 (quoting Edmond 
v.  United States,  520  U.S.  651,  663  (1997))  (internal quotation  marks  omitted).  The  Supreme 
Court has  long recognized Congress's authority to  place for-cause  limitations on the President's 
removal of"inferior Officers" whose appointment may be vested in the head of a department.  U.S. 
CONST.  ART.  II,  §  2,  cl.  2.  See  United  States  v.  Perkins,  116  U.S.  483,  485  (1886)  ("The 
constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment [ of inferior officers in the heads 
of departments]  implies  authority  to  limit,  restrict,  and  regulate  the  removal  by  such  laws  as 
Congress  may  enact  in  relation  to  the  officers  so  appointed")  (quoting  lower court  decision); 
Morrison, 487 U.S. at 689 n. 27 (citing Perkins); accord id. at 723-724 & n.4 (Scalia, J., dissenting) 
(recognizing that Perkins  is "established" law); see also Free Enterprise Fund,  561  U.S.  at 493-
495 ( citing Perkins and Morrison).  The category of inferior officers includes both the FBI Director 
and the  Special Counsel, each  of whom reports to the  Attorney General.  See 28 U.S.C.  §§  509, 
5 I 5(a), 531; 28 C.F .R. Part 600.  Their work is thus "directed and supervised" by a presidentially(cid:173)
appointed, Senate-confirmed officer.  See In re:  Grand Jury Investigation, _  F .3d _, 2019 WL 
921692, at *3-*4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2019) (holding that the Special Counsel is an "inferior officer" 
for constitutional purposes). 

Where the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the removal 
of an  Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to  bar removal 
for  the  corrupt  purpose  of obstructing justice.  Limiting  the, range  of permissible  reasons  for 
removal to exclude a "corrupt" purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring 
an  affirmative  showing of good cause.  It follows  that  for  such inferior officers, Congress may 
constitutionally restrict the  President's removal  authority  if that authority was exercised  for  the 
corrupt purpose of obstructing justice.  And even if a particular inferior officer's position might be 
of such  importance  to the  execution  of the  laws  that  the  President must  have  at-will  removal 
authority,  the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes  could  still  be  constitutionally  applied  to  forbid 
removal  for  a  corrupt  reason.1088  A  narrow  and  discrete  limitation  on  removal  that  precluded 
corrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over 
policy  or  loss  of confidence  in  the  officer's  judgment  or  commitment.  A  corrupt-purpose 
prohibition  therefore  would  not  undermine  the  President's  ability  to  perform  his  Article  II 
functions.  Accordingly,  because  the  separation-of-powers  question  is  "whether  the  removal 
restrictions  are  of  such  a  nature  that  they  impede  the  President's  ability  to  perform  his 
constitutional duty," Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on  removing an inferior officer for a

088 Although the FBT director is an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable 
by him at will, see 28 U.S.C. § 532 note, and it is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the 
FBI director with good-cause tenure protection.  See OLC,  Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the 
Term of the FBI Director, 2011  WL 2566125, at *3 (O.L.C. June 20, 2011) ("tenure protection for an officer 
with the FBT Director's broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise 
a serious constitutional question whether Congress  had  'impede[d]  the  President's ability to  perform  his 
constitutional duty' to take care that the laws be faithfully executed") ( quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691 ).

corrupt  reason-a  reason  grounded  in  achieving  personal  rather  than  official  ends-does  not 
seriously hinder the President's performance of his duties.  The President retains broad latitude to 
supervise  investigations  and  remove  officials,  circumscribed  in  this  context  only  by  the 
requirement that he not act for corrupt personal purposes.1089 

c.  Congress  Has  Power  to  Protect  Congressional,  Grand  Jury,  and 

Judicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source 

Where  a  law imposes  a  burden  on  the  President' s  performance  of Article  II  functions, 
separation-of-powers  analysis  considers  whether  the  statutory  measure  "is  justified  by  an 
overriding  need  to  promote  objectives  within  the  constitutional  authority  of  Congress." 
Administrator of General Services, 433  U.S. at 443.  Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-of(cid:173)
justice statutes to  protect,  among other things,  the  integrity of its  own  proceedings,  grand jury 
investigations, and federal  criminal trials.  Those objectives are within Congress ' s authority and 
serve strong governmental interests. 

i.  Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it 
to  all  persons-including  the  President.  Congress  clearly  has  authority  to  protect  its  own 
legislative  functions  against  corrupt  efforts  designed  to  impede  legitimate  fact-gathering  and 
lawmaking efforts.  See  Watkins v.  United States, 354 U.S.  178,  187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman 
v.  United States, 5 App. D.C. 122,  130 ( 1895).  Congress also has authority to establish a system 
of federal  courts, which includes the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts.  See 
U.S. CONST. ART. I,  § 8,  els.  9,  18  ("The Congress shall have Power ... To constitute Tribunals 
inferior to the supreme Court" and "To make all Laws which shall be  necessary and  proper for 
carrying into  Execution  the  foregoing  powers").  The long  lineage of the  obstruction-of-justice 
statutes, which can be traced to at least  183 I , attests to the necessity for that protection.  See An 
Act Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4  Stat. 487-488 § 2 (1831) (making 
it a crime if"any person or persons  shall corruptly ... endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede 
any juror,  witness,  or officer,  in any court of the United  States,  in  the discharge of his duty,  or 
shall, corruptly ... obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration 
of justice therein"). 

ii.  The  Article  TII  courts  have  an  equally  strong  interest  in  being  protected  against 
obstructive acts, whatever their source.  As the Supreme Court explained in  United States v.  Nixon, 
a "primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch" is "to do justice in criminal prosecutions." 
418 U.S.  at 707; accord  Cheney v.  United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 
U.S.  367,  384 (2004).  In Nixon,  the Court rejected  the President's claim of absolute executive 
privilege  because  "the  allowance  of the  privilege  to  withhold  evidence  that  is  demonstrably 

1089 The obstruction statutes do  not disqualify the President from  acting  in a case simply because 
he  has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may  be at issue.  As the Department of Justice 
has  made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability 
to  fulfill  his  constitutional  function.  See,  e.g.,  OLC,  Application  of 28  U.S.C.  §  458  to  Presidential 
Appointments of Federal Judges,  19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office 
of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re:  Conflict of Interest Problems 
Arising out of the President's Nomination of Nelson A.  Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty(cid:173)
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28,  1974)).

relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely 
impair  the  basic  function  of the  courts."  407  U.S.  at 712.  As Nixon  illustrates,  the  need  to 
safeguard judicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest.  See id.  at 709 (noting that the 
denial of full  disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens 
" [t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system"). 

iii.  Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from 
corrupt acts.  Serious federal  criminal  charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an 
indictment issued by a  grand jury.  Cobbledick v.  United States, 309 U.S.  323, 327 (1940) ("The 
Constitution  itself makes the  grand jury a  part of the judicial process.").  And the grand jury's 
function is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment.  U.S. CONST. AMEND. V . ("[n]o person shall be held 
to answer" for a serious crime "unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury").  "[T]he 
whole  theory  of [the  grand jury' s]  function  is  that  it  belongs  to  no  branch  of the  institutional 
government,  serving  as  a  kind  of buffer or  referee  between  the  Government  and  the  people," 
United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), "pledged to indict no one because of prejudice 
and to free no one because of special favor."  Costello v. United States, 350 U .S.  359, 362 (1956). 
If the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from  all persons,  its function  as 
an  independent charging body would  be thwarted.  And an  impartial grand jury investigation to 
determine whether probable cause exists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process. 

*

The final  step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separation(cid:173)

take  action  within 

of-powers  doctrine  permits  Congress  to 
its  constitutional  authority 
notwithstanding  the  potential  impact  on  Article  II  functions.  See  Administrator  of General 
Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S . at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon, 
418  U.S.  at 711-712.  In  the  case  of the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes,  our  assessment  of the 
weighing of interests  leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to  impose the  limited 
restrictions contained in  those statutes on the President's official  conduct to protect the  integrity 
of important functions of other branches of government. 

A  general ban on corrupt action does  not unduly intrude on the President's responsibility 
to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  U.S. CONST. ART IT,  §§ 3. 1090  To the contrary, 
the concept of "faithful execution" connotes the use of power in  the  interest of the public, not in 
the  office  holder's  personal  interests.  See  1  Samuel  Johnson,  A  Dictionary  of the  English 
Language 763  (1755) ("faithfully" def. 3: " [w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance").  And 
immunizing  the  President  from  the  generally  applicable  criminal  prohibition  against  corrupt 
obstruction  of official  proceedings would  seriously  impair Congress's power to  enact  laws  "to 
promote objectives within [its]  constitutional authority," Administrator of General Services,  433 
U.S. at 425-
i.e. , protecting the integrity of its own proceedings and the proceedings of Article TTI 
courts and grand juries. 

1090 As noted above, the President's selection and removal of principal executive officers may have 

a unique constitutional status. 

177

U.S. Department of Justice 

Accordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the 
President  has  blanket  constitutional  immunity  to  engage  in  acts  that  would  corruptly  obstruct 
justice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article TI  powers. 1091 

3.  Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the  Obstruction  Statutes Would 

Not Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties 

Applying  the  obstruction  statutes  to  the  President's  official  conduct  would  involve 
determining as a  factual  matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the  act had a 
nexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent.  But applying those 
standards to the President's official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II 
duties.  Cf Nixon v.  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S . at 752-753 & n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on 
the President in adopting a constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages 
action based on official duties).  Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect:  the existence 
of settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence 
of evidentiary limitations on probing the President's motives.  And historical experience confirms 
that no impermissible chill should exist. 

a.  As  an  initial  matter,  the  term  "corruptly"  sets  a  demanding  standard.  It  requires  a 
concrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an " improper advantage for [him]self 
or someone else,  inconsistent with  official duty and the  rights  of others."  BALLENTINE'S  LAW 
DICTIONARY 276 (3d ed.  1969); see United States v.  Pasha, 797 F .3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir.2015); 
Aguilar,  515  U.S.  at 616  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in  part and  dissenting  in  part).  That standard 
parallels the President's constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.  And 
virtually  everything  that  the  President  does  in  the  routine  conduct  of office  will  have  a  clear 
governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty.  Accordingly, the President has 
no reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible 
basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive. 

That  point  is  illustrated  by  examples  of conduct that would  and  would  not  satisfy  the 
stringent corrupt-motive  standard.  Direct or indirect action  by the  President to  end a  criminal 
investigation  into  his  own  or  his  family  members'  conduct  to  protect  against  personal 
embarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct. 
So  too  would action  to  halt an  enforcement proceeding that directly  and  adversely affected  the 
President's  financial  interests for the  purpose of protecting those  interests.  In  those  examples, 

1091  A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential 
criminal  liability after a President leaves office.  Impeachment would remove a President from office, but 
would not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law. 
Indeed,  the  Impeachment  Judgment  Clause  recognizes  that  criminal  law  plays  an  independent  role  in 
addressing an official's conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment.  See U.S. CONST. ART. 
l,  § 3, cl. 7.  Impeachment is  also a drastic and rarely  invoked  remedy, and Congress is not restricted to 
relying only on  impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to  a former President, as OLC 
has recognized.  A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.  O.L.C. 
at  255  ("Recognizing  an  immunity  from  prosecution  for  a  sitting  President  would  not  preclude  such 
prosecution once  the  President's term  is  over or he  is  otherwise  removed  from  office  by  resignation or 
impeachment."). 

178

U.S. Department of Justice 

official power  is  being  used for  the purpose of protecting the President's personal  interests.  In 
contrast, the President's actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt. 
The  President's  role  as  head  of the  government  necessarily  requires  him  to  take  into  account 
political factors  in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings. 
For  instance,  the  President's  decision  to  curtail  a  law-enforcement  investigation  to  avoid 
international  friction  would  not  implicate the  obstruction-of-justice  statutes.  The criminal  law 
does not seek to  regulate  the  consideration of such  political  or policy  factors  in  the conduct of 
government.  And when  legitimate interests animate the President's conduct, those interests will 
almost  invariably  be  readily  identifiable  based  on  objective  factors.  Because  the  President' s 
conduct  in  those  instances  will  obviously  fall  outside  the  zone  of obstruction  law,  no  chilling 
concern should arise. 

b.  There is  also  no  reason  to  believe that  investigations,  let  alone  prosecutions,  would 
occur except in  highly unusual  circumstances when a credible factual  basis exists to believe that 
obstruction  occurred.  Prosecutorial  action  enjoys  a  presumption  of regularity:  absent  "clear 
evidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official 
duties."  Armstrong,  517 U.S.  at 464 (quoting  United States  v.  Chemical Foundation,  Inc.,  272 
U.S .  I,  14-15 (1926)).  The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would  provide even  greater 
protection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any 
matter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and 
careful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice.  Under OLC's opinion that a 
sitting President is entitled to immunity from  indictment, only a successor Administration would 
be able to prosecute a former President.  But that consideration does not suggest that a President 
would have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office.  There 
are "obvious political checks" against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former 
President.  See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S.  at 448 (considering political checks 
in  separation-of-powers analysis).  And  the  Attorney General  holds  "the power to  conduct the 
criminal  litigation  of the  United  States Government,"  United States  v.  Nixon,  4 I 8  U.S.  at 694 
(citing  28  U.S.C.  §  516),  which  provides  a  strong  institutional  safeguard  against  politicized 
investigations or prosecutions. 1092 

1092  Similar  institutional  safeguards  protect  Department  of Justice  officers  and  line  prosecutors 
against  unfounded  investigations  into  prosecutorial  acts.  Prosecutors  are  generally  barred  from 
participating in matters implicating their personal  interests, see 28 C.F.R.  § 45.2, and are instructed not to 
be  influenced  by  their  "own  professional  or  personal  circumstances,"  Justice  Manual  §  9-27.260,  so 
prosecutors would  not frequently  be in a  position  to take  action  that could  be  perceived  as  corrupt  and 
personally motivated.  And  if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by  responsible 
officials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent 
a  credible  factual  basis.  Those  facts  distinguish  the  criminal  context  from  the  common-law  rule  of 
prosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by "a defendant [who] often will transform 
his  resentment at being  prosecuted  into  the  ascription  of improper  and  malicious  actions."  Imbler  v. 
Pachtman,  424  U.S.  409,425 (1976).  As  the Supreme Court has noted, the  existence of civil  immunity 
does not justify criminal immunity.  See O'Shea v.  Littleton, 414 U.S.  488, 503 (1974) ("Whatever may  be 
the case with respect to civil liability generally, ... we have never held that the performance of the duties 
of judicial,  legislative,  or  executive  officers,  requires  or contemplates  the  immunization  of otherwise 
criminal deprivation of constitutional rights.") (citations omitted).

These considerations distinguish the Supreme Court's holding in Nixon v.  Fitzgerald that, 
in part because inquiries into the President's motives would be "highly intrusive," the President is 
absolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on  his official conduct.  457 U.S. at 
756-757.  As Fitzgerald recognized, "there is a lesser public  interest in  actions for civil damages 
than, for example,  in  criminal  prosecutions."  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.  at 754 n.37; see Cheney,  542 
U.S. at 384.  And private actions are not subject to the institutional protections of an action under 
the  supervision of the Attorney General  and subject to a  presumption of regularity.  Armstrong, 
517 U.S. at 464. 

c. 

In  the  rare  cases  in  which  a  substantial  and  credible  basis justifies  conducting  an 
investigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he 
acted  for  a  corrupt  purpose  need  not  have  a  chilling  effect.  Ascertaining  the  President's 
motivations  would  turn  on  any  explanation  he  provided  to  justify  his  actions,  the  advice  he 
received,  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  actions,  and  the  regularity  or  irregularity  of the 
process he employed to  make decisions.  But grand juries and  courts would  not have  automatic 
access  to  confidential  presidential  communications  on  those  matters;  rather,  they  could  be 
presented in official proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need.  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 712; In 
re Sealed Case,  121  F .3d 729, 754, 756-757 (D.C. Cir.  1997); see also Administrator of General 
Services, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege, 
although successor's failure to support the claim "detracts from  [its] weight"). 

In  any  event,  probing  the  President's  intent  in  a  criminal  matter  is  unquestionably 
constitutional in at least one context:  the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive 
a thing of value in return for being influenced in official action.  18 U.S.C. § 20l(b)(2).  There can 
be  no  serious  argument against the  President's potential  criminal  liability for  bribery offenses, 
notwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent.  See U.S. CONST. ART. I, § 3; ART. IT, 
§ 4; see also Application of 28 US. C.  § 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges,  19 
Op. O.L.C.  at 357 n.11  ("Application of§ 20 I [to the  President]  raises  no separation of powers 
issue,  let alone a serious one."). 

d.  Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies 
exempting the President from  the obstruction laws.  As  a historical matter, Presidents have very 
seldom been the subjects  of grand jury investigations.  And it is  rarer still  for circumstances to 
raise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the 
President's use of official  power.  Accordingly,  the  President's conduct of office should not be 
chilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard 
in this context. 

* 

* 

* 

In sum, contrary to the  position  taken  by  the  President' s  counsel,  we concluded that,  in 
light of the Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues, we had a valid basis 
for investigating the conduct at issue in this report.  In our view, the application of the obstruction 
statutes would not impermissibly burden the President's performance of his Article II  function to 
supervise  prosecutorial  conduct  or  to  remove  inferior  law-enforcement  officers.  And  the 
protection  of  the  criminal  justice  system  from  corrupt  acts  by  any  person-including  the 
President-accords with  the fundamental  principle of our government that "[n]o [person]  in this

country is so high that he is above the law."  United States v.  Lee,  I 06 U.S.  196, 220 (1882); see 
also Clinton v.  Jones,  520 U.S.  at 697; United States v.  Nixon, supra.

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw 
ultimate  conclusions  about  the  President' s  conduct.  The  evidence  we  obtained  about  the 
President's actions and  intent presents difficult issues that would need to  be resolved  if we were 
making  a  traditional  prosecutorial judgment.  At the  same  time,  if we  had  confidence  after a 
thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, 
we would so state.  Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach 
that judgment.  Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a 
crime, it also does not exonerate him.

APPENDIXC 

INTRODUCTORY NOTE 

The  President  provided  written  responses  through  his  personal  counsel  to  questions 
submitted to him  by the  Special Counsel's  Office.  We  first  explain  the  process  that  led  to the 
submission of written questions and then attach the President' s responses. 

Beginning  in  December 2017,  this  Office sought for more than a  year to  interview the 
President on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice.  We 
advised counsel that the President was a "subject" of the investigation under the definition of the 
Justice Manual-"a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation." 
Justice Manual § 9-11.151  (2018).  We also advised counsel that"[ a]n interview with the President 
is vital to our investigation" and that this Office had "carefully considered the constitutional and 
other arguments raised by . ..  counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking 
an interview." 1  We additionally stated that "it is in the interest of the  Presidency and the public 
for  an  interview to  take  place"  and  offered  "numerous  accommodations to  aid  the  President's 
preparation and avoid surprise."2  After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about 
the  Special  Counsel's  objective  of securing  the  President's  testimony,  these  accommodations 
included the submissions of written questions to the President on certain Russia-related topics. 3 

We received the President's written responses in late November 2018.4  In December 2018, 
we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects.5  We noted, among 
other things,  that the  President  stated  on  more than  30 occasions that he "does  not  'recall'  or 
' remember'  or have  an  ' independent recollection"' of information called  for by  the questions. 6 
Other answers  were "incomplete  or imprecise." 7  The written  responses,  we informed  counsel, 
"demonstrate the  inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow(cid:173)
up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client' s recollection 
or clarify the  extent  or nature  of his  lack  of recollection." 8  We  again  requested  an  in-person 
interview,  limited to certain topics, advising the President' s counsel that "[t]his is the President' s

opportunity to  voluntarily provide us with information for  us  to  evaluate in the context of all of 
the evidence we have gathered."9  The President declined. 10 

Recognizing  that  the  President  would  not  be  interviewed  voluntarily,  we  considered 
whether to  issue a subpoena for his testimony.  We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. 
But at that point,  our investigation  had  made significant progress and  had produced  substantial 
evidence for our report.  We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, 
with  resulting  delay  in  finishing  our  investigation,  against  the  anticipated  benefits  for  our 
investigation  and  report.  As  explained  in  Volume  II,  Section  H.B.,  we  determined  that  the 
substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant 
factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence 
and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.

Response to Question l, Parts (a) through (c) 

I have  no  recollection  of learning at the  time  that  Donald  Trump,  Jr.,  Paul  Manafort, or  Jared 
Kushner was considering participating in  a meeting in June 2016 concerning potentially negative 
information about  Hillary  Clinton.  Nor do  I recall  learning during the campaign that the June 9, 
2016 meeting had taken place, that the referenced emails existed. or that Donald J. Trump, Jr., had 
other communications with  Emin  Agalarov or Robert Goldstone  between June 3,  2016 and June 
9, 2016. 

Response to Question I, Part {d) 

I have  no  independent recollection of what portion  of these four  days  in June of2016 I spent in 
Trump Tower. This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary 
season was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign. 

I am  now aware that my Campaign's calendar indicates that  I was in New York City  from June 6 
- 9, 2016. Calendars kept in  my Trump Tower office reflect that I had various calls and  meetings 
scheduled  for  each of these days. While those calls and  meetings  may or may  not actually have 
taken place, they do indicate that I was in Trump Tower during a portion of each of these working 
days, and  I have  no  reason  to  doubt  that  I was.  When  I was  in  New  York  City,  I stayed  at my 
Trump Tower apartment. 

My  Trump  Organization  desk  calendar  also  reflects  that  I  was  outside  Trump  Tower  during 
portions of these days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower 
in  the  early  evening  for  Westchester  where  I gave  remarks  after  winning  the  California, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day. The June 8, 
2016 calendar indicates a scheduled departure in  late afternoon to attend a ceremony at my  son's 
school.  The  June  9,  2016 calendar  indicates  I was  scheduled  to  attend  midday  meetings  and  a 
fundraising  luncheon at the  Four Seasons Hotel.  At  this point,  I do  not  remember on  what dales 
these  events  occurred,  but  I  do  not  currently  have  a  reason  to  doubt  that  they  took  place  as 
scheduled on my calendar. 

Widely  available  media  reports,  including  television  footage,  also  shed  light  on  my  activities 
during  these days.  For example,  I am  aware that my  June 7, 2016 victory  remarks at  the Trump

National Golf Club in  Briarcliff Manor, New York, were recorded and published by  the media. 1 
remember winning those primaries and generally recall delivering remarks that evening. 

At  this  point  in  time,  I do  not  remember whether I spoke or met  with  Donald  Trump, Jr.,  Paul 
Manafort, or Jared  Kushner on June 9, 2016.  My  desk calendar indicates I was scheduled to  meet 
with  Paul  Manafort on the morning of June 9,  but I do not recall if that meeting took place.  It was 
more than two years ago, at a time when I had  many calls and  interactions daily. 

· 

Response to Question I, Part (e) 

I  have  no  independent  recollection  of any  communications  I had  with  the  Agalarov  family  or 
anyone r understood to  be a representative of the Agalarov  family after June 3, 2016 and  before 
the end of the campaign. While  preparing to  respond to these questions, I have become aware of 
written  communications  with  the  Agalarovs  during  the  campaign  that  were  sent,  received,  and 
largely authored by my staff and which I understand have already been produced to you. 

In general, the documents include congratulatory letters on my campaign victories, emails about a 
painting  Emin  and  Aras  Agalarov  arranged  to  have  delivered  to  Trump  Tower  as  a  birthday 
present, and emails regarding delivery of a book written by Aras Agalarov.  The documents reflect 
that the deliveries were screened by the Secret Service. 

Response to Question I, Part (t) 

I do not recall  being aware during the campaign of communications between  Donald Trump, Jr., 
Paul Manafort, or Jared Kushner and any member or representative of the Agalarov family, Robert 
Goldstone, Natalia Yeselnitskaya (whose  name  I was not familiar with), or anyone  I understood 
to  be a Russian official. 

Response to Question I, Part (g) 

In  remarks  I delivered the  night  I won  the  California,  New  Jersey,  New  Mexico, Montana, and 
South  Dakota  Republican  primaries,  I  said,  "I  am  going  to  give  a  major  speech  on  probably 
Monday of next week and we're going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with 
the Clintons."  In  general,  l expected to give a speech referencing the publicly available, negative 
information  about  the  Clintons,  including,  for  example,  Mrs.  Clinton's  failed  policies,  the 
Clintons'  use  of the  State  Department  to  further  their  interests  and  the  interests  of the  Clinton 
Foundation,  Mrs.  Clinton's improper  use of a private server  for  State Department business,  the 
destruction of 33,000 emails on that server, and Mrs. Clinton's temperamental unsuitability for the 
office of President. 

In the course of preparing to  respond to  your questions, I have become aware that the  Campaign 
documents already  produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution, and sources of information for 
the  speech  I expected to  give "probably" on the Monday  fol lowing my  June  7, 2016 comments. 
These documents generally show that the text of the speech was initially drafted by Campaign staff

with  input from various outside advisors and was based on publicly available material, including, 
in  particular, information from the book CUnton Cash by Peter Schweizer. 

The  Pulse  Nightclub terrorist attack took  place  in  the  early  morning  hours  of Sunday, June  12, 
2016. In  light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed  more specifically to  national  security and 
terrorism than to  the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of 
Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following: 

This  was  going  to  be  a  speech  on  Hillary  Clinton  and  how  bad  a  President, 
especially  in  these  times  of Radical  Islamic  Terrorism,  she  would  be. Even  her 
former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, 
has stated that she  lacks the temperament and  integrity to  be  president. There will 
be plenty of oppo1tunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and  I will 
deliver that speech soon.  But today there is only one thing to discuss:  the growing 
threat of terrorism inside of our borders. 

I continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton's failings throughout the campaign, using the information 
prepared for inclusion in the speech to which  I referred on June 7, 2016. 

Response to Question I, Part (h) 

I  have  no  recollection  of being  told  during  the  campaign  that  Vladimir  Putin  or  the  Russian 
government "suppotted" my candidacy or "opposed" the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. However, 
I was aware of some reports indicating that President Putin  had made complimentary statements 
about me. 

Response to Question I, Part (i) 

I have no recollection of being told  during the campaign  that any  foreign  government or foreign 
leader had  provided, wished to provide, or offered to provide tangible support to my campaign.

Response to Question  II, Part (a) 

I do  not remember the date on which  it was publicly reported that the DNC had been hacked, but

Response to Question  U, Part (b) 

I recall  that in the months leading up to the election there was considerable media reporting about 
the possible hacking and release of campaign-related information and there was a lot of talk about 
this matter. At the time, I was generally aware of these media reports and may have discussed these 
issues with  my campaign staff or others, but  at  this  point in  time - more than two  years later - I 
have no recollection of any particular conversation, when  it occurred, or who the participants were. 

Response to Question II, Part (c) 

I do not recall being aware during  the campaign of any  communications between  the individuals 
named  in  Question  II  (c)  and  anyone  I understood  to  be a representative of WikiLeaks or any of 
the other individuals or entities referred to in  the question. 

Response to Question  II, Part (d) 

I made  the  statement quoted  in  Question  II  (d)  in jest and  sarcastically,  as  was apparent to  any 
objective observer. The context of the  statement  is  evident  in  the  full  reading or  viewing of the 
July 27,  2016  press conference, and  I refer you  to  the  publicly  available transcript and  video of 
that press conference. I do not recall having any discussion about the substance of the statement in 
advance of the  press conference. I do not recall  being told  during the campaign of any  efforts by 
Russia  to  infiltrate  or  hack  the  computer  systems  or  email  accounts  of Hillary  Clinton  or  her 
campaign prior to them  becoming the subject of media repo11ing and  I have no recollection of any 
particular conversation in that regard. 

Response to Question II, Part (e) 

I was in Trump Tower in New York  City on October 7, 2016.  I have no recollection of being told 
that  WikiLeaks possessed  or  might  possess  emails related  to  John  Podesta before the  release of 
Mr.  Podesta's emails  was  reported  by  the  media. Likewise,  I have no  recollection  of being told 
that Roger Stone, anyone acting as an intermediary for  Roger Stone, or anyone associated with my 
campaign had communicated with  WikiLeaks on October 7, 2016. 

Response to Question II, Part (0 

I do  not  recall  being  told  during  the  campaign  that  Roger  Stone or anyone associated  with  my 
campaign had discussions with  any of the entities named  in  the question  regarding the content or 
timing of release of hacked emails. 

Response to Question ll, Part (g) 

I  spoke  by  telephone  with  Roger  Stone  from  time  to  time  during  the  campaign.  I  have  no 
recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with  Mr.  Stone between June  1.2016 and

November 8, 2016. I do not recall  discussing  WikiLeaks with  him, nor do  I recall  being aware of 
Mr. Stone having discussed  WikiLeaks with  individuals associated with my campaign, although I 
was aware that WikiLeaks was the subject of media reporting and campaign-related discussion at 
the time. 

Response to Question II, Part (h) 

I do  not recall  having  had  any  discussion  during  the  campaign  regarding  a pardon  or action  to 
benefit Julian Assange. 

Response to Question II, Part (i) 

I do  not  recall  being  aware  during  the  campaign  of specific  effo11s  by  foreign  individuals  or 
companies to assist my  campaign through the use of social media postings or the organization of 
rallies. 

III. 

The Trump Organization Moscow Project 

a. 

In October 2015, a "Letter of Intent," a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B, was signed 
for a proposed Trump Organization project in  Moscow (the "Trump Moscow project"). 

1. 

When were you first informed of discussions about the Trump Moscow project? 
By whom? What were you told about the project? 

ii. 

Did you  sign the letter of intent? 

b. 

c. 

d. 

In a statement provided to Congress, attached as Exhibit C, Michael Cohen stated: "To the 
best of my  knowledge, Mr.  Trump was  never in contact with  anyone about this proposal 
other than me on three occasions, including signing a non-binding letter of intent in 2015." 
Describe all discussions you had with Mr. Cohen, or anyone else associated with the Trump 
Organization, about the Trump Moscow project, including who you spoke with, when, and 
the substance of the discussion(s). 

Did  you  learn  of any  communications  between  Michael  Cohen  or  Felix  Sater and  any 
Russian government officials, including officials in the office of Dmitry Peskov, regarding 
the  Trump Moscow project?  If so,  identify who provided  this  info1mation to  you, when, 
and the substance of what you  learned. 

Did you have any discussions between June 2015 and June 2016 regarding a potential trip 
to Russia by you and/or Michael Cohen for reasons related to the Trump Moscow project? 
If yes, describe who you spoke with, when, and the substance of the discussion(s). 

e. 

Did  you  at  any  time direct or suggest  that discussions about the Trump  Moscow project

should cease, or were  you  informed at any  time that the  project had  been abandoned?  If 
yes, describe who you spoke with, when, the substance of the discussion(s), and  why  that 
decision was made. 

f. 

g. 

Did you have any  discussions  regarding what information would  be provided publicly or 
in response to investigative inquiries about potential or actual investments or business deals 
the  Trump  Organization  had  in  Russia,  including  the  Trump  Moscow  project?  If yes, 
describe who you spoke with, when, and the substance of the discussion(s). 

Aside from the Trump Moscow project, did you or the Trump Organization have any other 
prospective or actual  business interests,  investments, or arrangements with  Russia or any 
Russian  interest or  Russian  individual  during the campaign? If yes, describe the  business 
interests, investments, or arrangements. 

Response to Question III, Parts (a) through (g) 

Sometime in 2015, Michael Cohen suggested to me the possibility of a Trump Organization project 
in Moscow. As I recall, Mr. Cohen described this as a proposed project of a general type we have 
done in the past in a variety of locations. I signed the non-binding Letter of Intent attached to your 
questions as Exhibit B which required no equity or expenditure on our end and was consistent with 
our ongoing efforts to expand into significant markets around the world. 

I had few conversations with Mr. Cohen on this subject. As I recall, they were brief, and they were 
not memorable. I was not enthused about the proposal, and 1 do not recall any discussion of travel 
to  Russia  in  connection  with  it.  I do not remember discussing  it with  anyone else at the Trump 
Organization, although it is possible. I do not recall being aware at the time of any communications 
between  Mr.  Cohen  or  Felix Sater and  any  Russian  government official regarding the  Letter of 
Intent.  In  the  course  of preparing  to  respond  to  your  questions,  I have  become  aware  that  Mr. 
Cohen  sent an  email  regarding  the  Letter of Intent  to  "Mr.  Peskov"  at a  general,  public  email 
account, which should show there was no meaningful relationship with people in  power in Russia. 
I understand those documents already have been provided to  you. 

I vaguely remember press  inquiries and  media reporting during the  campaign about whether the 
Trump Organization  had  business dealings  in  Russia.  I may have spoken with campaign staff or 
Trump  Organization  employees  regarding  responses  to  requests  for  information,  but  1 have  no 
current recollection of any  particular conversation, with  whom  L may  have spoken,  when, or  the 
substance of any conversation. As I recall, neither I nor the Trump Organization had  any  projects 
or proposed projects in Russia during the campaign other than the Letter of Tntent.

Were you  aware of whether Paul Manafort or anyone else associated with your campaign 
sent or directed others to send internal Trump campaign  information to any person located 
in  Ukraine or  Russia or  associated  with  the  Ukrainian  or  Russian  governments?  If yes, 
identify who provided you with this information, when, the substance of the discussion(s), 
what you  understood  the purpose was of sharing the  internal  campaign  information,  and 
how you responded to learning this information. 

Did  Paul  Manafort communicate to  you, directly or  indirectly.  any  positions  Ukraine or 
Russia  would  want  the  U.S.  to  support?  If yes,  describe  when  he  communicated  those 
positions to you and the substance of those communications. 

During the campaign, were you told about efforts by Russian officials to meet with you or 
senior members of your campaign? If yes, describe who you had conversations with on this 
topic, when, and what you were told. 

What  role,  if any,  did  you  have  in  changing  the  Republican  Party  platform  regarding 
arming Ukraine during the Republican National Convention? Prior to the convention, what 
information did you  have about this platform provision? After the platform provision was 
changed, who told you about the change, when did they tell you, what were you told about 
why it was changed, and who was involved? 

On July 27, 2016, in response to a question about whether you would recognize Crimea as 
Russian  territory and  lift sanctions on  Russia,  you  said:  "We' ll  be  looking at that.  Yeah, 
we'll be  looking." Did you  intend  to  communicate by  that statement or at any other time 
during  the campaign a willingness to lift sanctions and/or recognize Russia's annexation 
of Crimea if you were elected? 

1. 

What consideration  did  you give  to  lifting sanctions  and/or recognizing  Russia's 
annexation of Crimea if you were elected? Describe who you spoke with about this 
topic, when, the substance of the discussion(s). 

Response to Question IV, Parts (a) through (d) 

Mr.  Manafort was  hired  primarily because of his delegate work for prior presidential candidates, 
including  Gerald  Ford,  Ronald  Reagan,  George  H.W.  Bush,  and  Bob  Dole.  I  knew  that  Mr. 
Manafort had done international consulting work and,  at some time before Mr.  Manafort left the

campaign, I learned that he was somehow involved with  individuals concerning Ukraine, but I do 
not remember the specifics of what I knew at the time. 

l  had  no  knowledge  of Mr.  Manafort offering  briefings on  the  progress  of my  campaign  to  an 
individual named Oleg Deripaska, nor do  I remember being aware of Mr. Manafort or anyone else 
associated  with  my  campaign  sending  or  directing  others  to  send  internal  Trump  Campaign 
information to anyone I knew to be in  Ukraine or Russia at the time or to anyone I understood to 
be  a  Ukrainian  or  Russian  government  employee  or  official.  I do  not  remember  Mr.  Manafort 
communicating to me any  particular positions Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to 
support. 

Response to Question IV, Part (e) 

I do  not recall  being told  during the campaign of efforts by  Russian  officials to  meet with  me or 
with senior members of my campaign.  In  the process of preparing to respond to these questions, I 
became  aware  that  on  March  17,  2016,  my  assistant at  the  Trump  Organization,  Rhona  Graff, 
received an  email  from  a Sergei Prikhodko, who identified  himself as  Deputy Prime Minister of 
the Russian Federation, Foundation Roscongress, inviting me  to participate in  the St.  Petersburg 
International  Economic  Forum  to  be  held  in  June  2016.  The documents  show  that  Ms.  Graff 
prepared for my signature a brief response declining the invitation. I understand these documents 
already have been produced to you. 

Response to Question IV, Part (t) 

I have  no  recollection of the details of what, when, or from  what source  I first  learned about the 
change to the platform amendment regarding arming Ukraine, but I generally recall  learning of the 
issue as  pa1t of media  reporting.  I do not recall  being  involved  in  changing the language  to  the 
amendment.

APPENDIXD 

SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE TRANSFERRED, REFERRED, AND COMPLETED CASES 

This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel's Office, as 

well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed. 

A.  Transfers 

The Special Counsel's Office has concluded its  investigation  into  links  and coordination 
between the  Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain 
matters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the 
date of this report.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office 
has transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice 
and the FBI.  Those transfers include: 

1.  United States v.  Bijan Rafiekian and Kami! Ekim Alptekin 

US. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia 
(Awaiting trial) 

The Acting Attorney General authorized the  Special Counsel to  investigate, among other 
things,  possible  criminal  conduct  by  Michael  Flynn  in  acting  as  an  unregistered  agent  for  the 
Government of Turkey.  See August 2,  2017 Memorandum from  Rod J.  Rosenstein to Robert S. 
Mueller,  III.  The  Acting  Attorney  General  later confirmed the  Special  Counsel's  authority  to 
investigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they "may have been jointly involved" with Flynn in 
FARA-related  crimes.  See  October  20,  2017  Memorandum  from  Associate  Deputy  Attorney 
General Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. 

On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an  Information charging him with making 
false  statements to the FBI  about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the  United States. 
As  part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a  Statement of the Offense  in  which he acknowledged that 
the  Foreign Agents  Registration Act (FARA) documents  he filed  on  March  7,  2017 "contained 
materially false statements and omissions."  Flynn' s plea occurred before the Special Counsel had 
made a  final  decision  on whether  to  charge  Rafiekian  or Alptekin.  On  March 27,  2018,  after 
consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel' s Office referred 
the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action 
it deemed  appropriate.  The  Special  Counsel's  Office  determined  the  referral  was  appropriate 
because the  investigation of Flynn  had  been  completed, and that investigation had provided  the 
rationale for the Office' s investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.  At NS D's request, the Eastern 
District of Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.
